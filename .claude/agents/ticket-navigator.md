# Ticket Navigator Subagent

## Purpose

Quickly identifies the next incomplete ticket and stage from the project plan. Provides concise, actionable output without fluff.

## When to Use

Use this subagent when:

- Starting work with `/next_ticket` slash command
- Need to determine current progress in the project plan
- Checking which ticket/stage to work on next
- Verifying completion status of tickets

## Capabilities

This subagent:

1. Reads `plan/EPIC.md` to find the next incomplete ticket
2. Checks if a `TICKET-###-implementation-plan.md` exists
3. Determines the next incomplete stage in the implementation plan
4. Reports findings in a concise, structured format

## How to Invoke

Use the Task tool with the `ticket-navigator` subagent:

```
Use the Task tool:
- description: "Find next ticket and stage"
- prompt: "Please read plan/EPIC.md to find the next incomplete ticket.
  Then check if a TICKET-###-implementation-plan.md exists for that ticket.
  If it does, determine the next incomplete stage.

  Report your findings in this exact format:

  Next Ticket: TICKET-###
  Title: [ticket title]
  Implementation Plan: [EXISTS | DOES NOT EXIST]
  Next Stage: [stage name if plan exists, otherwise N/A]

  Do not add any additional commentary or explanation."
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
```

## Output Format

The subagent MUST respond in this exact format:

```
Next Ticket: TICKET-XXX
Title: [Brief ticket title]
Implementation Plan: [EXISTS | DOES NOT EXIST]
Next Stage: [Stage name/number | N/A]
```

### Examples

**Example 1: Ticket with existing plan and incomplete stage**

```
Next Ticket: TICKET-012
Title: Implement Condition System
Implementation Plan: EXISTS
Next Stage: Stage 3: Add GraphQL Resolvers
```

**Example 2: Ticket without implementation plan**

```
Next Ticket: TICKET-015
Title: Add Event Scheduler Worker
Implementation Plan: DOES NOT EXIST
Next Stage: N/A
```

**Example 3: Ticket with plan but all stages complete**

```
Next Ticket: TICKET-010
Title: Implement World Time System
Implementation Plan: EXISTS
Next Stage: All stages complete
```

**Example 4: All tickets complete**

```
Next Ticket: None
Title: N/A
Implementation Plan: N/A
Next Stage: All tickets in epic are complete
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Concise output only**: No additional explanations, context, or commentary
2. **Exact format**: Always use the 4-line format shown above
3. **Accuracy**: Correctly identify incomplete tickets and stages
4. **Read carefully**: Check for `[x]` (complete) vs `[ ]` (incomplete) markers
5. **No assumptions**: If unclear, report what you found, don't guess

## Integration with `/next_ticket` Command

The `/next_ticket` slash command will:

1. Invoke this subagent to determine next ticket and stage
2. Use the subagent's output to decide next action:
   - If plan DOES NOT EXIST → Create implementation plan
   - If plan EXISTS → Begin work on next stage
3. Report the findings to the user

## File Patterns to Check

### EPIC.md Structure

Look for tickets marked with `[ ]` (incomplete):

```markdown
- [x] TICKET-001: Completed ticket
- [ ] TICKET-002: Next incomplete ticket ← Start here
- [ ] TICKET-003: Future ticket
```

### Implementation Plan Structure

Look for stages marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete):

```markdown
## Stage 1: Setup

- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2

## Stage 2: Implementation ← Next stage

- [ ] Task 1 ← First incomplete task
- [ ] Task 2
```

## Error Handling

If issues are encountered:

- **EPIC.md not found**: Report "Error: plan/EPIC.md not found"
- **No incomplete tickets**: Report "Next Ticket: None" (see Example 4)
- **Implementation plan exists but unreadable**: Report "Implementation Plan: EXISTS (ERROR READING)"
- **Ambiguous state**: Report what was found and note the ambiguity

## Notes

- This subagent is optimized for speed and clarity
- Output is designed to be parsed by the `/next_ticket` command
- No implementation work should be done by this subagent
- Only read plan files, never modify them
