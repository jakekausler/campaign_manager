# CLAUDE.md Condensation Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Reduce CLAUDE.md from 1,722 lines to ~800 lines (53% reduction) to optimize AI context window usage while preserving information accessibility.

**Architecture:** Extract detailed guides to `docs/development/` directory, replace verbose feature sections with ultra-brief 1-line index, condense subagent examples to essentials + decision tree, keep all core workflow rules inline.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown documentation, no code changes required.

---

## Task 1: Create Directory Structure

**Files:**

- Create: `docs/development/` directory

**Step 1: Create docs/development/ directory**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/development
```

**Step 2: Verify directory exists**

Run: `ls -la docs/`
Expected: Should show `development/` directory

**Step 3: Commit directory structure**

```bash
git add docs/development/.gitkeep
git commit -m "docs(development): create directory for detailed development guides

Part of CLAUDE.md condensation to reduce token usage by moving
detailed guides to separate files while keeping core workflow
rules in CLAUDE.md.

## TypeScript Tester

**Full Description:**

Run and debug existing TypeScript tests; ensure code is fixed to match tests, not vice versa.

**When to Use (Detailed):**

- Running existing tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- Debugging test failures
- Understanding why tests are failing
- Fixing implementation code to make existing tests pass

**DO NOT Use For:**

- Writing new tests (base agent should write tests)
- Writing new implementation code (base agent should implement)
- Refactoring existing code (base agent should refactor)
- TDD development (base agent should write tests and code, this agent only runs them)

**Detailed Invocation Examples:**

Example 1 - Running tests after writing them:
```

Use Task tool with typescript-tester subagent:

- description: "Run and debug tests for [package/feature]"
- prompt: "I've written tests for [feature] in [file path]. Please run the tests
  and if any fail, analyze the failures and fix the implementation code (not the
  tests) to make them pass while preserving the intended functionality."
- subagent_type: "typescript-tester"

```

Example 2 - Debugging specific test failures:
```

Use Task tool with typescript-tester subagent:

- description: "Fix failing tests in users service"
- prompt: "The following tests are failing in @campaign/api:

  FAIL packages/api/src/users/users.service.test.ts
  UserService
  ‚úï should create user with valid data (15 ms)

  Expected: { id: '1', name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }
  Received: { id: '1', name: 'Alice' }

  Please analyze the test to understand expected behavior and fix the implementation
  code to make the test pass."

- subagent_type: "typescript-tester"

```

Example 3 - Running full test suite:
```

Use Task tool with typescript-tester subagent:

- description: "Run all tests for api package"
- prompt: "Please run all tests in @campaign/api package and report results.
  If any tests fail, analyze failures and fix implementation code."
- subagent_type: "typescript-tester"

```

## Creating New Subagents

If you need a specialized subagent for a recurring task:

1. Create a markdown file in `.claude/agents/`
2. **REQUIRED**: Add YAML frontmatter header at the top:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: subagent-name
   description: Brief description of what the subagent does.
   ---
````

3. Define the purpose, capabilities, and usage
4. Update CLAUDE.md to document it

**Frontmatter Header Format:**

- `name`: kebab-case name matching the filename (without .md)
- `description`: One sentence describing the subagent's purpose
- Must be enclosed in `---` delimiters

---

**Related Documentation:**

- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - Main development guide
- [.claude/agents/](../../.claude/agents/) - Subagent definitions

````

**Step 2: Verify file created**

Run: `wc -l docs/development/subagent-guide.md`
Expected: ~150-170 lines

**Step 3: Commit subagent guide**

```bash
git add docs/development/subagent-guide.md
git commit -m "docs(subagents): extract detailed subagent guide from CLAUDE.md

Moved 150 lines of detailed subagent invocation examples to dedicated
guide to reduce CLAUDE.md token usage. Content includes:
- Detailed 'DO NOT use for' lists for each subagent
- Full prompt templates with all parameters
- Multiple example scenarios per subagent
- What each subagent checks/verifies (detailed bullets)
- Creating new subagents guide

CLAUDE.md will retain essential summary table, generic invocation
pattern, one detailed example (Code Reviewer), and decision tree.

Part of CLAUDE.md condensation (53% reduction target).

```

Do NOT commit yet - will commit all CLAUDE.md changes together in Task 7.

---

## Task 5: Condense Subagent Usage Section

**Files:**

- Modify: `CLAUDE.md:384-653` (Subagent Usage section)

**Step 1: Replace Subagent Usage section with condensed version**

Replace lines 384-653 in CLAUDE.md with:

```markdown
## Subagent Usage

**CRITICAL RULE FOR BASE AGENT**: The base agent must NEVER run tests, debug test failures, fix TypeScript errors, or fix linting errors directly. Always delegate these tasks to the appropriate specialized subagent.

### Available Subagents (Summary)

| Subagent          | Purpose                             | When to Use                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript Tester | Run and debug existing tests        | Test failures, need to run tests        |
| TypeScript Fixer  | Fix TypeScript/ESLint errors        | Type errors, lint errors, import issues |
| Code Reviewer     | **MANDATORY** before commits        | Every commit with code changes          |
| Project Manager   | **MANDATORY** before ticket closure | Every ticket completion                 |
| Prisma Debugger   | Prisma/database issues              | Schema, migration, query errors         |
| Ticket Navigator  | Find next incomplete work           | `/next_ticket` command                  |

**Invocation Pattern (All Subagents):**
```

Use Task tool with subagent_type: "<name>"

- description: "Brief action description"
- prompt: "[Detailed context and expectations]"

```

**Example - Code Reviewer (MANDATORY before every commit):**

```

Use Task tool with code-reviewer subagent:

- description: "Review code changes before commit"
- prompt: "Please review the code changes that are staged for commit. Analyze for:
  1. Best practices and code quality
  2. Security vulnerabilities
  3. Performance issues
  4. Unnecessary complexity
  5. Type safety and error handling
  6. Project convention adherence

  Provide specific feedback with file paths and line numbers. Flag any critical
  issues that must be addressed before commit."

- subagent_type: "code-reviewer"

```

**See [docs/development/subagent-guide.md](docs/development/subagent-guide.md) for detailed examples and patterns for each subagent.**

### Subagent Decision Tree

When you encounter an issue, use this decision tree:

```

Are you about to commit code?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí **MANDATORY:** Use Code Reviewer subagent FIRST
‚îÇ Only commit after approval
‚îÇ
Are you about to mark a ticket as complete?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí **MANDATORY:** Use Project Manager subagent FIRST
‚îÇ Only close ticket after approval
‚îÇ
Is it a test failure or need to run tests?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use TypeScript Tester subagent to RUN and DEBUG
‚îÇ
Do you need to write new tests?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Write tests directly
‚îÇ
Is it a TypeScript compilation error?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use TypeScript Fixer subagent
‚îÇ
Is it an ESLint error?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use TypeScript Fixer subagent
‚îÇ
Is it a module resolution or import error?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use TypeScript Fixer subagent
‚îÇ
Is it a Prisma/database error?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Prisma Database Debugger subagent
‚îÇ
Is it a runtime logic error or bug?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Debug directly, write test to prevent regression
‚îÇ
Is it a feature implementation task?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Write tests and implementation directly,
‚îÇ use TypeScript Tester to run tests,
‚îÇ use TypeScript Fixer for type/lint verification,
‚îÇ use Code Reviewer before commit,
‚îÇ use Project Manager before closing ticket
‚îÇ
Otherwise ‚Üí Handle directly or create new specialized subagent

```

```

**Step 2: Verify replacement**

Run: `grep -n "^## Subagent Usage" CLAUDE.md`
Expected: Should show condensed section

**Step 3: Stage changes**

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md
```

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline -5

# Revert to before condensation
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or reset to before condensation (if not pushed)
git reset --hard <commit-before-condensation>
```
