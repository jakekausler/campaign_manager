# Test runner wrapper that handles Vitest worker crashes gracefully

# This script runs Vitest and checks if the only error is a worker crash
# that occurred after most tests passed. This is a known issue with large
# test suites where memory accumulates even with proper cleanup.

# Memory allocation: 3GB wrapper (1 fork × 3GB = 3GB total, safe for 7GB CI runners)
# Performance impact: Sequential file execution reduces memory spikes
#

# Run tests and capture output and exit code
# Allocate 3GB to match single fork allocation
