# TICKET-001: Project Scaffolding & Repository Setup

## Status

- [x] Completed
- **Commits**: 73ff6bb

## Description

Initialize the monorepo structure with all necessary services, establish coding standards, configure linting/formatting, and set up basic CI/CD pipeline configuration.

## Scope of Work

1. Create monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces
2. Initialize service directories:
   - `packages/api` - NestJS backend
   - `packages/rules-engine` - Node worker service
   - `packages/scheduler` - Node worker service
   - `packages/frontend` - React + Vite application
   - `packages/shared` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities
3. Configure root-level tooling:
   - TypeScript (strict mode, shared tsconfig.base.json)
   - ESLint with recommended configs
   - Prettier for formatting
   - Husky for git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)
   - lint-staged
4. Set up pnpm workspace configuration in pnpm-workspace.yaml
5. Set up package.json scripts for:
   - Building all services
   - Running linters/formatters
   - Running tests across all packages
6. Configure GitHub Actions workflow for:
   - Linting and type checking
   - Running tests
   - Building all packages
7. Create basic README.md with:
   - Project overview
   - Setup instructions (using pnpm)
   - Development workflow
8. Initialize git repository with .gitignore (include .pnpm-store)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All service directories exist with package.json files
- [x] TypeScript compiles successfully across all packages
- [x] ESLint and Prettier run without errors
- [x] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits with linting errors
- [x] Root-level build script successfully builds all packages
- [x] README contains clear setup instructions

## Technical Notes

- Use pnpm workspaces for dependency management (pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- Unified versioning strategy - all packages share the same version number
- Shared types should be in `packages/shared/src/types`
- Use path aliases (`@campaign/shared`, `@campaign/api`, etc.) configured in tsconfig
- pnpm advantages: faster installs, disk space efficiency, strict dependency resolution

### pnpm-workspace.yaml example:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
```

### Root package.json scripts example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "pnpm -r build",
    "dev": "pnpm -r --parallel dev",
    "lint": "pnpm -r lint",
    "test": "pnpm -r test",
    "type-check": "pnpm -r type-check"
  }
}
```

## Architectural Decisions

- **Monorepo vs Multi-repo**: Monorepo chosen for easier code sharing and coordinated changes
- **Workspace Manager**: Native pnpm workspaces (simpler, no extra tooling needed)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for speed and efficiency
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automation
- **Versioning**: Unified versioning across all packages

## Dependencies

- None (this is the first ticket)

## Testing Requirements

- Verify that `pnpm install` works from root
- Verify that `pnpm run build` builds all packages
- Verify that `pnpm run lint` catches intentional errors
- Verify that git hooks prevent bad commits
- Verify that GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully

## Estimated Effort

1-2 days

## Implementation Notes

Successfully completed all aspects of project scaffolding and repository setup:

### Monorepo Structure

- Created pnpm workspace with 5 packages: api, rules-engine, scheduler, frontend, shared
- Each package initialized with appropriate package.json and entry points
- Configured workspace commands for parallel and sequential execution

### TypeScript Configuration

- Set up tsconfig.base.json with strict mode enabled
- Configured per-package tsconfig.json extending base configuration
- Frontend uses ESNext modules for Vite compatibility
- Backend packages use CommonJS for Node.js compatibility
- Path aliases configured for @campaign/\* imports

### Code Quality Tools

- ESLint configured with TypeScript support and import ordering rules
- Prettier configured for consistent formatting (2 spaces, single quotes, 100 char width)
- Frontend-specific ESLint config for React and JSX
- All linting rules pass successfully

### Git Hooks

- Husky pre-commit hook runs lint-staged for automatic linting/formatting
- Pre-push hook runs type-check and tests
- Hooks successfully tested and working

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow configured with 3 jobs:
  - Lint and Type Check
  - Tests
  - Build
- Uses pnpm action for caching and speed
- Runs on push and PR to main/develop branches

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Development workflow documentation
- Monorepo command examples
- Architecture overview

### Files Created

- Root: package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, tsconfig.base.json
- Config: .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc.json, .lintstagedrc.json
- Git: .gitignore (updated), .husky/pre-commit, .husky/pre-push
- CI/CD: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Packages: 5 packages with package.json, tsconfig.json, and src/
- Documentation: README.md

All acceptance criteria met. Build, lint, and type-check all pass successfully.
