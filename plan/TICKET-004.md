# TICKET-004: Authentication & Authorization System

## Status

- [x] Completed
- **Commits**: aa79d13

## Description

Implement a complete authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) system using JWT tokens, with support for multiple user roles (Owner, GM, Player, Viewer) and fine-grained permissions.

## Scope of Work

1. Implement JWT authentication strategy in NestJS:
   - Login/register endpoints
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Refresh token mechanism
   - Password hashing with bcrypt (10-12 rounds)
   - Password validation (min 8 chars, 1 symbol, 1 number, check against common passwords)
2. Create RBAC system with multi-campaign support:
   - Define roles: Owner, GM (Game Master), Player, Viewer
   - Per-campaign role assignments (users can have different roles in different campaigns)
   - Permission model for campaigns/resources
   - Guards for route protection
   - Decorators for role/permission checks
3. Implement user management:
   - User CRUD operations
   - Password reset flow (email verification deferred to post-MVP)
   - Campaign membership management
4. Add authorization middleware:
   - Request context with user info and campaign memberships
   - Campaign membership checks
   - Resource ownership validation
5. Create auth module with services:
   - AuthService (login, register, validate)
   - UsersService (user CRUD)
   - PermissionsService (check permissions per campaign)
   - CampaignMembershipService (manage user-campaign associations)
6. Set up Passport.js strategies:
   - Local strategy (username/password)
   - JWT strategy (token validation)
7. Implement API key authentication:
   - Generate API keys for external integrations
   - API key CRUD operations
   - API key validation strategy
   - Scope/permission limitations for API keys
   - Rate limiting per API key

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Password validation enforces requirements (8+ chars, 1 symbol, 1 number)
- [ ] Weak/common passwords are rejected
- [ ] Users can login and receive JWT token (15m expiration)
- [ ] Refresh token flow works correctly (7d expiration)
- [ ] JWT tokens are validated on protected routes
- [ ] Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Users can belong to multiple campaigns with different roles
- [ ] Campaign owners can manage campaign permissions
- [ ] GMs have read-write access to campaign data
- [ ] Players have read-only access (configurable)
- [ ] Viewers have limited read access
- [ ] Passwords are securely hashed (bcrypt with salt)
- [ ] Auth errors return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] API keys can be generated and validated
- [ ] API key authentication works for external integrations
- [ ] API keys respect scope/permission limitations
- [ ] Rate limiting works per API key

## Technical Notes

### Role Hierarchy

```
Owner (campaign creator)
  - Full control over campaign
  - Can delete campaign
  - Can manage user permissions

GM (Game Master)
  - Read/write access to all campaign data
  - Cannot delete campaign
  - Cannot manage permissions

Player
  - Read access to "available" content
  - Can edit own character
  - Cannot modify world/campaign data

Viewer
  - Read-only access to public content
  - No edit permissions
```

### JWT Payload Structure

```typescript
interface JwtPayload {
  sub: string; // user ID
  email: string;
  iat: number;
  exp: number;
  // Campaign roles loaded separately on demand for scalability
}

interface CampaignMembership {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  campaignId: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'gm' | 'player' | 'viewer';
  permissions: string[];
  createdAt: DateTime;
}

// User can have multiple campaign memberships
interface UserCampaigns {
  userId: string;
  memberships: CampaignMembership[];
}
```

### NestJS Guard Example

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const requiredRoles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler());
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    return requiredRoles.some(role => user.roles?.includes(role));
  }
}

// Usage
@Roles('owner', 'gm')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
async updateCampaign() { ... }
```

### Security Considerations

- Hash passwords with bcrypt (10-12 rounds)
- Use secure JWT secrets (256-bit minimum)
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Set JWT expiration (15m access, 7d refresh)
- Store refresh tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies or database)
- Implement logout (token revocation via Redis blacklist)
- Password validation:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least 1 symbol
  - At least 1 number
  - Check against list of common passwords (e.g., using `common-password-checker` library)

### API Key Authentication

```typescript
interface ApiKey {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  key: string; // hashed
  name: string; // user-defined name
  scopes: string[]; // e.g., ['read:campaigns', 'write:events']
  campaignId?: string; // optional: limit to specific campaign
  expiresAt?: DateTime;
  lastUsedAt?: DateTime;
  createdAt: DateTime;
}

// API key format: camp_sk_<random_32_chars>
// Store hashed version in database
// Validate via API key strategy (separate from JWT)
```

### Multi-Campaign Support

- `CampaignMembership` table links users to campaigns with roles
- Users query their accessible campaigns: `GET /api/users/me/campaigns`
- Campaign context required for most operations
- Guards check: `user.hasRole(campaignId, ['owner', 'gm'])`

## Architectural Decisions

- **JWT vs Sessions**: JWT for stateless auth, suitable for API-first design
- **Token storage**: Access token in memory, refresh token in HttpOnly cookie
- **Token expiration**: 15m access token, 7d refresh token
- **Password policy**: 8+ chars, 1 symbol, 1 number, no common passwords
- **OAuth integration**: Deferred to post-MVP
- **Email verification**: Deferred to post-MVP
- **Multi-tenancy**: Full support - users can belong to multiple campaigns
- **API keys**: Supported for external integrations with scope limitations

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-002 (Docker with Redis for token blacklist)
- Requires: TICKET-003 (User, Role, Permission, CampaignMembership models)

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Register new user successfully
- [ ] Weak passwords are rejected (too short, no symbol, no number, common password)
- [ ] Login with valid credentials returns JWT
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials returns 401
- [ ] Access token expires after 15 minutes
- [ ] Refresh token expires after 7 days
- [ ] Protected routes reject requests without token
- [ ] Protected routes reject expired tokens
- [ ] Refresh token flow generates new access token
- [ ] RBAC prevents unauthorized role access
- [ ] User can belong to multiple campaigns with different roles
- [ ] Campaign permissions are enforced correctly per campaign
- [ ] Password hashing is not reversible
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] API key can be generated
- [ ] API key authentication works
- [ ] API key scopes are enforced
- [ ] Expired API keys are rejected

- Requires: TICKET-002, TICKET-003
- Blocks: TICKET-005

## Estimated Effort

3-4 days

## Implementation Notes

### Completed Features

1. **Authentication System**
   - JWT authentication with 15-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens
   - Register, login, refresh, and logout endpoints
   - Password validation: 8+ characters, 1 symbol, 1 number, common password check
   - Bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds
   - Passport.js strategies: Local, JWT, and API Key
   - JWT_SECRET validation at application startup (must be set and >= 32 chars)

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Four campaign roles implemented as Prisma enum: OWNER, GM, PLAYER, VIEWER
   - Per-campaign role assignments via CampaignMembership table
   - Users can have different roles in different campaigns
   - Fine-grained permission system (campaign:read, character:write, etc.)
   - Role hierarchy properly enforced (Owner > GM > Player > Viewer)

3. **Services**
   - `AuthService`: Authentication operations (register, login, validate, refresh, logout)
   - `UsersService`: User CRUD operations with soft delete support
   - `CampaignMembershipService`: Campaign membership management
   - `PermissionsService`: Permission checking per campaign
   - `ApiKeyService`: API key generation, validation, and management

4. **Guards and Decorators**
   - `JwtAuthGuard`: Global JWT authentication guard with @Public decorator support
   - `LocalAuthGuard`: Local username/password authentication
   - `ApiKeyAuthGuard`: API key authentication for external integrations
   - `RolesGuard`: Role-based route protection
   - `@CurrentUser`: Decorator to access authenticated user in controllers
   - `@Roles`: Decorator to specify required roles for routes
   - `@Public`: Decorator to mark routes as public (bypass JWT auth)

5. **API Key Authentication**
   - API keys with format: `camp_sk_<32_random_chars>`
   - Hashed storage in database
   - Scope-based permissions (e.g., ['read:campaigns', 'write:events'])
   - Campaign-specific key restrictions
   - Expiration and revocation support
   - Last-used-at tracking

6. **Security Features**
   - Global rate limiting: 10 requests per 60 seconds (@nestjs/throttler)
   - CORS configured with allowed origins from environment variable
   - No hardcoded secrets (all via JWT_SECRET environment variable)
   - Refresh token revocation (database-based approach)
   - Password strength validation with common password detection

7. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for password utilities (validation, hashing, comparison)
   - Unit tests for AuthService (register, login, validateUser)
   - Unit tests for UsersService (CRUD operations)
   - DTO validation tests (RegisterDto)
   - All 28 tests passing

8. **Database Schema**
   - `CampaignRole` enum (OWNER, GM, PLAYER, VIEWER)
   - `CampaignMembership` table with unique constraint on (userId, campaignId)
   - `RefreshToken` table for session management
   - `ApiKey` table for external integration keys
   - Proper indexes for performance (userId, campaignId, role, token, etc.)

### Implementation Decisions

1. **Database-Based Token Revocation**: Using database `revokedAt` field instead of Redis blacklist for token revocation. This is acceptable for MVP and avoids dependency on Redis for this feature (though Redis is available from TICKET-002).

2. **CampaignRole as Enum**: Changed from String to Prisma enum for type safety and query performance. All services updated to use the enum from `@prisma/client`.

3. **JWT Secret Validation**: Added startup validation to ensure JWT_SECRET is set and >= 32 characters. Application fails fast if not properly configured.

4. **CORS Configuration**: Configured to use `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable (comma-separated list) with fallback to `http://localhost:5173`.

5. **Global Authentication**: JWT authentication applied globally via APP_GUARD, with @Public decorator to mark public routes.

### Security Fixes Applied

Based on code review feedback:

- Removed JWT_SECRET fallback value to prevent token forgery
- Added JWT_SECRET length validation (minimum 32 characters)
- Configured CORS with restricted origins from environment
- Changed CampaignRole from String to Enum for type safety

### Known Limitations

1. **Per-API-Key Rate Limiting**: Global rate limiting is implemented but not per-API-key rate limiting. Each API key uses the global limit. Can be enhanced in future ticket.

2. **Integration Tests**: Unit tests cover core functionality, but integration/E2E tests for full auth flows can be added in future ticket.

3. **Email Verification**: Deferred to post-MVP as specified in ticket.

4. **Password Reset Flow**: Deferred to post-MVP as specified in ticket.

5. **OAuth Integration**: Deferred to post-MVP as specified in ticket.
