# TICKET-013 Implementation Plan: State Variable System

## Overview

Implement a StateVariable system for storing and querying dynamic campaign state (flags, counters, computed values) with different scopes (world, campaign, party, character, location, settlement, structure, etc.). This system will enable flexible state management and support derived variables computed from expressions.

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Database Schema and Prisma Model ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (Commit: ec59dfb)

**Goal**: Create StateVariable database schema with support for multiple scopes and versioning

**Tasks**:

- [x] Design StateVariable Prisma model with fields:
  - `id` (String, CUID primary key)
  - `scope` (String enum: world/campaign/party/kingdom/settlement/structure/character/location/event/encounter)
  - `scopeId` (String, nullable for world-level vars)
  - `key` (String, variable name within scope)
  - `value` (Json, nullable for derived variables)
  - `type` (String enum: string/integer/float/boolean/json/derived)
  - `formula` (Json, nullable, JSONLogic expression for derived variables)
  - `description` (String, nullable)
  - `isActive` (Boolean, default true)
  - `deletedAt` (DateTime, nullable, soft delete)
  - `version` (Int, optimistic locking)
  - `createdAt`/`updatedAt` (DateTime)
  - `createdBy`/`updatedBy` (relations to User)
- [x] Add composite unique constraint on (scope, scopeId, key, deletedAt)
- [x] Add indexes:
  - Composite (scope, scopeId, key) for scope-based lookups
  - Composite (scope, scopeId, isActive) with partial WHERE deletedAt IS NULL
  - Individual on isActive, deletedAt for filtering
  - Individual on createdBy, partial on updatedBy for audit queries
- [x] Add CHECK constraints:
  - Type validation (string/integer/float/boolean/json/derived)
  - Formula/value relationship (derived must have formula, others must have value)
- [x] Create Prisma migration
- [x] Run migration on development database
- [x] Verify migration with Prisma Studio
- [x] Code review and address critical issues
- [x] Commit Stage 1

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Migration applies successfully
- [x] Schema matches technical requirements
- [x] Can query variables by scope and key
- [x] Supports all 10 scope types including settlement and structure
- [x] Database constraints enforce data integrity
- [x] Partial indexes optimize common query patterns

**Tests**:

- Manual verification with Prisma Studio

- [x] Create enum `VariableType` (string/integer/float/boolean/json/derived)
- [x] Create type `StateVariable` with all fields
- [x] Create input `CreateStateVariableInput`:
  - scope, scopeId, key, value (nullable), type, formula (nullable), description (nullable)
- [x] Create input `UpdateStateVariableInput`:
  - value (nullable), formula (nullable), description (nullable), isActive (nullable), expectedVersion (nullable)
- [x] Create input `StateVariableWhereInput` for filtering:
  - scope, scopeId, key, isActive, type, createdBy, createdAfter, createdBefore, includeDeleted
- [x] Create input `EvaluateVariableInput`:
  - id, context (Json, nullable)
- [x] Create type `VariableEvaluationResult`:
  - variableId, key, scope, scopeId, value (Json), success, error (nullable), trace (nullable)
- [x] Create enum `StateVariableSortField` (key, scope, type, createdAt, updatedAt)
- [x] Create input `StateVariableOrderByInput` (field, order ASC/DESC)
- [x] Add schema documentation for all types
- [x] Verify type-check passes
- [x] Commit Stage 2

- [x] Update Settlement/Structure computed field resolution:
  - Pass includeVariables=true when building evaluation context
  - Variables are now accessible in condition expressions via `var.{key}` notation
- [x] Write integration tests:

- **Variable Namespace**: Variables accessible in expressions via `var.{key}` notation (e.g., `{ "var": "var.merchant_count" }`)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation - failures return basic context without throwing exceptions
- **Testing**: 14 comprehensive integration tests + updated existing tests for new dependencies (89 total tests passing)
- **Code Review**: Approved with no critical issues - clean integration, excellent test coverage, proper security

**Files Created**:

  - Traverses scope entity relationships to find campaign ID
  - Supports 9 scope types (campaign/party/kingdom/settlement/structure/character/event/encounter)
  - Throws appropriate error for location scope (no direct campaign)
- [x] Write integration tests (16 tests):

**Implementation Notes**:

StateVariableService Enhancements:

- **Versioning Support**: Added optional branchId and worldTime parameters to update() method
  - Creates Version snapshot when branchId provided
  - Uses transaction to atomically update variable + create version
  - Backward compatible - existing callers continue to work without modifications
- **getCampaignIdForScope()** helper: Traverses entity relationships to find campaign ID
  - Supports 9 scope types with optimized single-level nested selects
  - Handles settlement → kingdom → campaign traversal
  - Handles structure → settlement → kingdom → campaign traversal
- **getVariableAsOf()** method: Temporal queries for historical variable state
  - Uses VersionService.resolveVersion() for bitemporal resolution
  - Returns null if no version exists for specified time
  - Throws error for world-scoped variables (no campaign association)
- **getVariableHistory()** method: Retrieves full version history
  - Returns all Version records ordered by validFrom DESC
  - Includes version metadata (version number, validFrom, validTo, createdBy, createdAt)

**Features**:

- Optional version tracking on variable updates (opt-in via branchId parameter)
- Integrates with Campaign.currentWorldTime for default validFrom
- Supports custom worldTime parameter for explicit version timing
- World-scoped variables explicitly excluded from versioning
- Transaction-safe updates prevent race conditions
- Bitemporal queries via validFrom/validTo timestamps

**Security**:

- Authorization verified via findById() before all operations

- Transaction-safe updates with optimistic locking

**Performance**:

- Optimized database queries with single-level nested selects
- Transaction used for atomic variable update + version creation
- Audit logging outside transaction to avoid blocking
- No N+1 query patterns introduced

**Backward Compatibility**:

- branchId and worldTime parameters are optional
- Existing callers continue to work without modifications
- Versioning is opt-in, not mandatory

**Testing**:

## Technical Dependencies

- **TICKET-006**: Entity CRUD operations (required for scope entity queries)
- **TICKET-011**: JSONLogic Expression Parser (required for derived variable formulas)
- **TICKET-012**: Condition System (integration point for variable resolution)
- **TICKET-007**: Versioning System (required for variable change history)
- **TICKET-010**: World Time System (integration for temporal queries)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Complexity**: 10 different scope types to support
   - Mitigation: Start with core scopes (world, campaign, party, settlement, structure), add others iteratively
   - Mitigation: Use helper method for scope access verification to centralize logic

2. **Circular Dependencies**: Variables referencing other variables
   - Mitigation: Implement dependency tracking in Stage 4
   - Mitigation: Detect circular references during formula validation
   - Mitigation: Consider deferring dependency graph to TICKET-014

3. **Performance**: Context building may require multiple queries
   - Mitigation: Document N+1 query patterns as future optimization opportunities
   - Mitigation: Consider DataLoader pattern in future iteration

4. **Formula Validation**: Complex expressions may bypass validation
   - Mitigation: Reuse ExpressionParserService validation from TICKET-011
   - Mitigation: Enforce depth limit (10 levels) to prevent recursion attacks

## Notes

- This implementation follows the same pattern as TICKET-012 (Condition System)
- StateVariable and FieldCondition are complementary systems:
  - StateVariable: Stores mutable state values (flags, counters, computed values)
  - FieldCondition: Defines rules for computed entity fields based on expressions
- Variables can be referenced in both FieldCondition expressions and derived variable formulas
- The variable system will be a critical building block for the Rules Engine (TICKET-015)
