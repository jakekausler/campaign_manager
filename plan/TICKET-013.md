## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Database Schema and Prisma Model (ec59dfb)

**Completed:** 2025-10-17

**Summary:** Created comprehensive StateVariable model with support for derived variables, audit trails, and optimistic locking.

**Key Changes:**

- Renamed fields to semantic names:
  - `name` → `key` (variable name within scope)
  - `entityType` → `scope` (world/campaign/party/kingdom/settlement/structure/character/location/event/encounter)
  - `entityId` → `scopeId` (nullable for world-level variables)
- Added new fields:
  - `formula` (Json, nullable) - JSONLogic expressions for derived variables
  - `description` (String, nullable) - Human-readable explanation
  - `isActive` (Boolean) - Enable/disable flag
  - `version` (Int) - Optimistic locking version
  - `createdBy/updatedBy` (String) - Audit trail with User foreign keys
- Implemented database constraints:
  - CHECK constraint for type validation (string/integer/float/boolean/json/derived)
  - CHECK constraint enforcing derived variables have formulas, non-derived have values
  - Foreign key constraints with appropriate ON DELETE behavior
- Optimized indexes:
  - Composite index on (scope, scopeId, key) for exact lookups
  - Partial index on (scope, scopeId, isActive) WHERE deletedAt IS NULL for common queries
  - Partial index on updatedBy WHERE updatedBy IS NOT NULL for sparse column efficiency
  - Individual indexes on isActive, createdBy for filtering
- Enhanced soft delete pattern:
  - Unique constraint includes deletedAt to allow key reuse after deletion
  - NULL deletedAt values treated as distinct

**Migration Safety:**

- Populates createdBy for existing rows before adding NOT NULL constraint
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing polymorphic relations
- All foreign keys properly configured

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing all critical issues.

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated StateVariable model and User relations
- `packages/api/prisma/migrations/20251017140736_update_state_variable_model/migration.sql` - Comprehensive migration with constraints and optimized indexes

### Stage 2: GraphQL Type Definitions (b6d254f)

**Completed:** 2025-10-17

**Summary:** Created comprehensive GraphQL type definitions and input types for StateVariable operations with support for derived variables.

**Key Changes:**

- Type Definitions:
  - `VariableScope` enum with 10 scope types (world, campaign, party, kingdom, settlement, structure, character, location, event, encounter)
  - `VariableType` enum with 6 data types (string, integer, float, boolean, json, derived)
  - `StateVariable` type with all fields including formula support for derived variables
  - `VariableEvaluationResult` type with detailed trace information for debugging
  - `EvaluationStep` type for step-by-step evaluation trace
- Input Types:
  - `CreateStateVariableInput` with conditional validation (derived requires formula, non-derived requires value)
  - `UpdateStateVariableInput` with optimistic locking via expectedVersion
  - `StateVariableWhereInput` with comprehensive filtering (scope, type, active, dates)
  - `StateVariableSortField` enum and `StateVariableOrderByInput` for flexible sorting
  - `EvaluateVariableInput` for variable evaluation with custom context
- Validation:
  - Used `ValidateIf` decorators for conditional requirements based on variable type
  - Comprehensive class-validator decorators on all inputs
  - Enum registration with descriptive GraphQL documentation
- Alignment:
  - All fields match Prisma schema from Stage 1
  - Consistent with FieldCondition implementation patterns
  - Follows project conventions for type definitions

**Code Review Notes:**

- Approved by code-reviewer subagent with suggestions for Stage 3
- Campaign scope authorization to be handled in service layer (no direct Prisma relation)
- Formula depth validation (max 10 levels) to be implemented in service layer
- Value type validation to be implemented in service layer

**Files Created:**

- `packages/api/src/graphql/types/state-variable.type.ts` - GraphQL type definitions
- `packages/api/src/graphql/inputs/state-variable.input.ts` - Input type definitions

### Stage 6: Variable Resolution for Conditions (bf77940)

**Completed:** 2025-10-17

**Summary:** Integrated StateVariable system with Condition evaluation context, enabling FieldCondition expressions to reference StateVariable values via JSONLogic expressions.

**Core Changes:**

ConditionEvaluationService enhancements:

- Added `buildContextWithVariables()` async method that:
  - Accepts optional `includeVariables` parameter (default: false)
  - Requires `scope` and `scopeId` parameters when includeVariables is true
  - Fetches active StateVariables for the specified scope/scopeId
  - Evaluates both stored and derived variables via VariableEvaluationService
  - Merges variables into context under 'var' namespace (e.g., var.merchant_count)
  - Gracefully handles errors (returns basic context if fetching fails)
- Added private `fetchScopeVariables()` helper that:
  - Queries StateVariable table with proper filtering (scope, scopeId, isActive, deletedAt)
  - Evaluates each variable using VariableEvaluationService
  - Handles evaluation failures gracefully (logs errors, continues with other variables)
  - Returns key-value map for context merging
- Injected PrismaService and VariableEvaluationService dependencies
- Preserved existing `buildContext()` for backward compatibility

Settlement/Structure Services:

- Updated `getComputedFields()` to call `buildContextWithVariables()`
- Passes `includeVariables=true`, scope type, and entity ID
- Variables now accessible in condition expressions via `var.{key}` notation
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Features:**

Variable Access in Conditions:

- Conditions can reference StateVariable values: `{ ">=": [{ "var": "var.merchant_count" }, 10] }`
- Supports both stored values and derived variable evaluation during context building
- Mixed entity/variable references: `{ "and": [{ ">=": [{ "var": "settlement.population" }, 5000] }, { "==": [{ "var": "var.has_trade_route" }, true] }] }`
- Graceful handling of missing variables (undefined treated as null/false by JSONLogic)

Error Handling:

- Database query failures return basic context without variables (no exceptions thrown)
- Variable evaluation failures skip that variable and continue processing others
- All errors logged with appropriate context without exposing sensitive data
- Graceful degradation ensures computed fields functionality doesn't break

**Testing:**

Integration Tests (14 tests, all passing):

- Context building with/without variables
- Parameter validation (missing scope/scopeId warnings)
- Variable fetching for settlement and structure scopes
- Derived variable formula evaluation during context building
- Empty variable results handling
- Failed evaluations and database error recovery
- Condition evaluation with variable references
- Mixed entity and variable references in expressions

Test Updates:

- Added jest-mock-extended dependency for cleaner test mocking
- Updated existing service tests to mock new dependencies
- All 89 tests passing across affected services (condition-evaluation, settlement, structure, integration)

**Performance Notes:**

Known Limitations (acceptable for Stage 6):

- N+1 query pattern in `getComputedFields` when called for multiple entities (documented in code comments)
- Sequential variable evaluation (could be parallelized with Promise.all in future)
- These are acceptable trade-offs for simplicity and can be optimized in future iterations

**Security:**

- Authorization delegated to calling services (Settlement/Structure already perform auth checks)
- Parameterized queries via Prisma ORM prevent SQL injection
- Graceful error handling prevents information leakage
- No sensitive data exposed in logs (only error messages logged)

**Code Review:**

- Approved by code-reviewer subagent with no critical issues
- Clean integration with existing systems
- Follows project conventions and patterns
- Excellent test coverage with comprehensive scenarios
- Well-documented with JSDoc comments

**Integration:**

This stage completes the key integration between TICKET-012 (Condition System) and TICKET-013 (StateVariable System). Settlement and Structure entities can now have computed fields that depend on both entity properties and variable values, enabling powerful dynamic behavior like:

- Trade hub status based on population AND merchant count variable
- Structure profitability based on level AND daily revenue variable
- Settlement prosperity based on population AND derived prosperity_level variable

### Stage 7: Variable Change History Integration (5bca36c)

**Completed:** 2025-10-17

**Summary:** Implemented bitemporal version tracking for StateVariables with support for temporal queries and Campaign.currentWorldTime integration.

**Core Changes:**

StateVariableService Enhancements:

- **VersionService Integration**: Injected VersionService for version snapshot management
- **update() Method Enhancement**: Modified to optionally create Version snapshots
  - Added optional `branchId` parameter to enable versioning
  - Added optional `worldTime` parameter for version validFrom
  - Falls back to Campaign.currentWorldTime or current system time
  - Uses transaction to atomically update variable + create version
  - Backward compatible - skips versioning when branchId not provided
  - Only campaign-scoped and below variables supported (world-scoped excluded)
- **getCampaignIdForScope() Helper**: Traverses scope entity relationships to find campaign ID
  - Supports 9 scope types (campaign/party/kingdom/settlement/structure/character/event/encounter)
  - Uses optimized single-level nested Prisma selects
  - Throws appropriate error for location scope (no direct campaign association)
- **getVariableAsOf() Method**: Temporal queries for historical variable state
  - Retrieves variable state at specific point in world time
  - Uses VersionService.resolveVersion() for bitemporal resolution
  - Returns null if no version exists for specified time
  - Throws error for world-scoped variables
- **getVariableHistory() Method**: Full version history retrieval
  - Returns all Version records ordered by validFrom DESC
  - Includes version metadata (version number, validFrom, validTo, createdBy, createdAt)
  - Throws error for world-scoped variables

**Features:**

Version Tracking:

- Optional version snapshots on variable updates when branchId provided
- Integrates with Campaign.currentWorldTime for default validFrom
- Supports custom worldTime parameter for explicit version timing
- World-scoped variables explicitly excluded from versioning (no campaign association)
- Transaction-safe updates prevent race conditions

Temporal Queries:

- Query variable state as it existed at any point in world time
- Full version history retrieval for audit and debugging
- Bitemporal support via validFrom/validTo timestamps

**Testing:**

Integration tests (16 tests, all passing):

- Version snapshot creation with branchId parameter
- Skipping versioning when branchId not provided (backward compatibility)
- World-scoped variable handling (no versioning)
- Custom worldTime parameter usage
- Fallback to Campaign.currentWorldTime or system time
- Branch validation and error handling
- Historical state retrieval via getVariableAsOf
- Version history retrieval via getVariableHistory
- Campaign ID resolution for all scope types
- Error handling for world-scoped and invalid variables

**Security:**

- Authorization verified via findById() before all operations
- Branch ownership validated against variable's campaign
- Parameterized queries via Prisma ORM prevent SQL injection
- Transaction-safe updates with optimistic locking
- Silent access denial prevents information disclosure

**Performance:**

- Optimized database queries with single-level nested selects
- Transaction used for atomic variable update + version creation
- Audit logging outside transaction to avoid blocking
- No N+1 query patterns introduced

**Backward Compatibility:**

- branchId and worldTime parameters are optional in update()
- Existing callers continue to work without modifications
- Versioning is opt-in, not mandatory
- Non-breaking API changes

**Code Review:**

- Approved by code-reviewer subagent with no critical issues
- Security: Proper authorization, no SQL injection, safe transaction handling
- Performance: Optimized queries, no N+1 patterns
- Type Safety: All types correctly declared
- Testing: Comprehensive coverage (16/16 tests passing)
