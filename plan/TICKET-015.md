# TICKET-015: Rules Engine Service Worker

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - 924a965 - Implementation plan created
  - 3717b35 - Stage 1: Service package setup complete

## Description

Create a dedicated Node.js worker service for the rules engine that evaluates conditions, maintains dependency graphs, performs incremental recomputation, and communicates via gRPC/HTTP and Redis pub/sub.

## Scope of Work

1. Create rules-engine service package
2. Implement gRPC/HTTP API interface
3. Build evaluation engine
4. Implement incremental recomputation
5. Add Redis pub/sub for invalidations
6. Create caching layer
7. Add health checks and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rules engine runs as separate service
- [ ] API service can request rule evaluations
- [ ] Incremental recomputation on state changes
- [ ] Publishes invalidations via Redis
- [ ] Caches evaluation results
- [ ] Performance <50ms for typical evaluations

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-014

## Estimated Effort

5-6 days

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Service Package Setup (Complete - 3717b35)

Created the foundational NestJS service structure for the Rules Engine Worker with all necessary dependencies and configuration:

**Package Structure**:

- Established `packages/rules-engine/` with proper NestJS architecture
- Created `src/main.ts` with application bootstrap and logger setup
- Created `src/app.module.ts` as root module (empty, ready for future services)
- Added Jest configuration for testing framework

**Dependencies Added**:

- NestJS core: `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/platform-express`
- gRPC: `@grpc/grpc-js`, `@grpc/proto-loader` (for Stage 2)
- Redis: `ioredis` (for Stage 6 pub/sub)
- Caching: `node-cache` (for Stage 5)
- Database: `@prisma/client`, `prisma` (read-only access)
- Rules: `json-logic-js` (for Stage 3 evaluation)
- Testing: `jest`, `ts-jest`, `jest-mock-extended`

**Configuration**:

- TypeScript configuration with decorators enabled
- Environment variables documented in `.env.example`:
  - Database connection (read-only)
  - HTTP port (3001 for health checks)
  - gRPC port (50051)
  - Redis connection
  - Cache configuration (TTL, max size)
  - Log level
- NPM scripts: dev, build, start, test, lint, type-check, clean

**Documentation**:

- Comprehensive README.md covering:
  - Architecture overview and technology stack
  - Design principles and performance goals
  - Development commands and workflows
  - Project structure
  - Integration points with API service
  - Future enhancement roadmap

**Validation**:

- ✅ Package builds successfully
- ✅ Service starts and logs "Rules Engine Worker ready" message
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ Code review approved with no critical issues

**Next Stage**: Stage 2 - gRPC Service Definition
