# TICKET-015: Rules Engine Service Worker

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - 924a965 - Implementation plan created
  - 3717b35 - Stage 1: Service package setup complete
  - 0ec4355 - Stage 2: gRPC service definition and server complete

## Description

Create a dedicated Node.js worker service for the rules engine that evaluates conditions, maintains dependency graphs, performs incremental recomputation, and communicates via gRPC/HTTP and Redis pub/sub.

## Scope of Work

1. Create rules-engine service package
2. Implement gRPC/HTTP API interface
3. Build evaluation engine
4. Implement incremental recomputation
5. Add Redis pub/sub for invalidations
6. Create caching layer
7. Add health checks and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rules engine runs as separate service
- [ ] API service can request rule evaluations
- [ ] Incremental recomputation on state changes
- [ ] Publishes invalidations via Redis
- [ ] Caches evaluation results
- [ ] Performance <50ms for typical evaluations

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-014

## Estimated Effort

5-6 days

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Service Package Setup (Complete - 3717b35)

Created the foundational NestJS service structure for the Rules Engine Worker with all necessary dependencies and configuration:

**Package Structure**:

- Established `packages/rules-engine/` with proper NestJS architecture
- Created `src/main.ts` with application bootstrap and logger setup
- Created `src/app.module.ts` as root module (empty, ready for future services)
- Added Jest configuration for testing framework

**Dependencies Added**:

- NestJS core: `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/platform-express`
- gRPC: `@grpc/grpc-js`, `@grpc/proto-loader` (for Stage 2)
- Redis: `ioredis` (for Stage 6 pub/sub)
- Caching: `node-cache` (for Stage 5)
- Database: `@prisma/client`, `prisma` (read-only access)
- Rules: `json-logic-js` (for Stage 3 evaluation)
- Testing: `jest`, `ts-jest`, `jest-mock-extended`

**Configuration**:

- TypeScript configuration with decorators enabled
- Environment variables documented in `.env.example`:
  - Database connection (read-only)
  - HTTP port (3001 for health checks)
  - gRPC port (50051)
  - Redis connection
  - Cache configuration (TTL, max size)
  - Log level
- NPM scripts: dev, build, start, test, lint, type-check, clean

**Documentation**:

- Comprehensive README.md covering:
  - Architecture overview and technology stack
  - Design principles and performance goals
  - Development commands and workflows
  - Project structure
  - Integration points with API service
  - Future enhancement roadmap

**Validation**:

- ✅ Package builds successfully
- ✅ Service starts and logs "Rules Engine Worker ready" message
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ Code review approved with no critical issues

**Next Stage**: Stage 2 - gRPC Service Definition

---

### Stage 2: gRPC Service Definition (Complete - 0ec4355)

Implemented complete gRPC infrastructure with Protocol Buffer service definition, NestJS gRPC server, and comprehensive test coverage:

**Protocol Buffer Service**:

- Created `proto/rules-engine.proto` with 5 RPC method definitions:
  - `EvaluateCondition` - Single condition evaluation with trace support
  - `EvaluateConditions` - Batch evaluation with dependency ordering option
  - `GetEvaluationOrder` - Topological sort for conditions
  - `ValidateDependencies` - Cycle detection in dependency graph
  - `InvalidateCache` - Cache invalidation for campaign/branch
- All message types properly defined with nullable fields and repeated fields
- Future-proof design supporting tracing, performance metrics, and batch operations

**TypeScript Type Generation**:

- Created `src/generated/rules-engine.types.ts` with TypeScript interfaces matching proto definitions
- Proper camelCase conversion from snake_case proto field names
- Service interface (`IRulesEngineService`) for future implementation reference
- All types properly exported for use in controller and future services

**gRPC Server Configuration**:

- Updated `src/main.ts` to create hybrid NestJS application with both gRPC and HTTP transports
- gRPC server listening on port 50051 (configurable via `GRPC_PORT` env var)
- HTTP server on port 3001 for health checks
- Proper proto file loading with `@grpc/proto-loader` configuration

**Controller Implementation**:

- Created `src/controllers/rules-engine.controller.ts` with stub implementations for all 5 RPC methods
- All methods decorated with `@GrpcMethod` for proper gRPC routing
- Stub responses return success with placeholder data for integration testing
- Clear documentation indicating Stage 3 will implement real evaluation logic

**Logging and Error Handling**:

- Implemented `src/interceptors/grpc-logging.interceptor.ts` for global request/response logging
- Request ID generation for correlation across log messages
- Performance timing logged for all requests
- Proper error transformation to gRPC `RpcException` with status codes
- Stack traces preserved in error details for debugging

**Module Configuration**:

- Updated `src/app.module.ts` to register controller and global interceptor
- Interceptor registered via `APP_INTERCEPTOR` provider for all gRPC methods
- Clean dependency injection structure ready for Stage 3 services

**Testing**:

- Created `src/controllers/rules-engine.controller.test.ts` with 12 unit tests:
  - Single condition evaluation (stub)
  - Batch evaluation with multiple conditions
  - Empty condition list handling
  - Evaluation order retrieval
  - Dependency validation (no cycles)
  - Cache invalidation
- Created `src/interceptors/grpc-logging.interceptor.test.ts` with 4 unit tests:
  - Successful request logging
  - Error transformation to RpcException
  - RpcException passthrough
  - Request duration measurement
- All 16 tests passing

**Dependencies**:

- Added `@nestjs/microservices@^10.4.20` for gRPC support
- Aligned NestJS versions across all packages to v10.4.20 for compatibility

**Validation**:

- ✅ All unit tests passing (16 tests)
- ✅ TypeScript type-check passing with no errors
- ✅ ESLint passing (import ordering auto-fixed)
- ✅ Code review approved with no critical issues
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all stub implementations
- ✅ Proto file accessible at runtime via correct relative path

**Next Stage**: Stage 3 - Evaluation Engine Core
