---

### Stage 2: gRPC Service Definition (Complete - 0ec4355)

Implemented complete gRPC infrastructure with Protocol Buffer service definition, NestJS gRPC server, and comprehensive test coverage:

**Protocol Buffer Service**:

- Created `proto/rules-engine.proto` with 5 RPC method definitions:
  - `EvaluateCondition` - Single condition evaluation with trace support
  - `EvaluateConditions` - Batch evaluation with dependency ordering option
  - `GetEvaluationOrder` - Topological sort for conditions
  - `ValidateDependencies` - Cycle detection in dependency graph
  - `InvalidateCache` - Cache invalidation for campaign/branch
- All message types properly defined with nullable fields and repeated fields
- Future-proof design supporting tracing, performance metrics, and batch operations

**TypeScript Type Generation**:

- Created `src/generated/rules-engine.types.ts` with TypeScript interfaces matching proto definitions
- Proper camelCase conversion from snake_case proto field names
- Service interface (`IRulesEngineService`) for future implementation reference
- All types properly exported for use in controller and future services

**gRPC Server Configuration**:

- Updated `src/main.ts` to create hybrid NestJS application with both gRPC and HTTP transports
- gRPC server listening on port 50051 (configurable via `GRPC_PORT` env var)
- HTTP server on port 3001 for health checks
- Proper proto file loading with `@grpc/proto-loader` configuration

**Controller Implementation**:

- Created `src/controllers/rules-engine.controller.ts` with stub implementations for all 5 RPC methods
- All methods decorated with `@GrpcMethod` for proper gRPC routing
- Stub responses return success with placeholder data for integration testing
- Clear documentation indicating Stage 3 will implement real evaluation logic

**Logging and Error Handling**:

- Implemented `src/interceptors/grpc-logging.interceptor.ts` for global request/response logging
- Request ID generation for correlation across log messages
- Performance timing logged for all requests
- Proper error transformation to gRPC `RpcException` with status codes
- Stack traces preserved in error details for debugging

**Module Configuration**:

- Updated `src/app.module.ts` to register controller and global interceptor
- Interceptor registered via `APP_INTERCEPTOR` provider for all gRPC methods
- Clean dependency injection structure ready for Stage 3 services

**Testing**:

- Created `src/controllers/rules-engine.controller.test.ts` with 12 unit tests:
  - Single condition evaluation (stub)
  - Batch evaluation with multiple conditions
  - Empty condition list handling
  - Evaluation order retrieval
  - Dependency validation (no cycles)
  - Cache invalidation
- Created `src/interceptors/grpc-logging.interceptor.test.ts` with 4 unit tests:
  - Successful request logging
  - Error transformation to RpcException
  - RpcException passthrough
  - Request duration measurement
- All 16 tests passing

**Dependencies**:

- Added `@nestjs/microservices@^10.4.20` for gRPC support
- Aligned NestJS versions across all packages to v10.4.20 for compatibility

**Validation**:

- ✅ All unit tests passing (16 tests)
- ✅ TypeScript type-check passing with no errors
- ✅ ESLint passing (import ordering auto-fixed)
- ✅ Code review approved with no critical issues
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all stub implementations
- ✅ Proto file accessible at runtime via correct relative path

**Next Stage**: Stage 3 - Evaluation Engine Core

---

### Stage 3: Evaluation Engine Core (Complete - d1d8563)

Implemented the core condition evaluation logic for the rules engine worker, integrating the gRPC interface with actual JSONLogic evaluation capabilities:

**New Service - EvaluationEngineService** (498 lines):

- Core service for evaluating Field Condition expressions using JSONLogic
- Single condition evaluation (`evaluateCondition`) with full lifecycle:
  - Database lookup via Prisma
  - Condition active status validation
  - JSONLogic expression structure validation (max depth: 10 levels)
  - Context building from entity data
  - Expression evaluation using `json-logic-js`
  - Variable extraction and resolution
  - Detailed trace generation for debugging
- Batch condition evaluation (`evaluateConditions`):
  - Sequential evaluation of multiple conditions
  - Returns map of condition IDs to results
  - Note: Stage 4 will add dependency-based ordering
- Private helper methods:
  - `buildContext`: Formats entity data for JSONLogic variable access
  - `validateExpression`: Validates structure and prevents excessive nesting (DoS protection)
  - `validateNestedExpression`: Recursive depth validation
  - `extractVariables`: Extracts all `{ "var": "..." }` references from expressions
  - `resolveVariable`: Resolves dot-notation paths (e.g., "kingdom.population")
  - `evaluateExpression`: Core JSONLogic evaluation with error handling
- Lifecycle management with `onModuleDestroy` for Prisma cleanup
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Performance measurement (evaluation time tracking)

**Controller Integration**:

- Updated `RulesEngineController` to use `EvaluationEngineService` via dependency injection
- Implemented real logic for `evaluateCondition` RPC:
  - JSON context parsing with error handling
  - Delegation to evaluation engine
  - Returns full evaluation result with trace
- Implemented real logic for `evaluateConditions` RPC:
  - JSON context parsing
  - Batch evaluation via engine
  - Total time measurement
  - Note added: dependency ordering in Stage 4
- Added try-catch blocks for JSON.parse errors
- Removed stub implementations

**Module Registration**:

- Registered `EvaluationEngineService` as provider in `AppModule`
- Updated module documentation to reflect Stage 3 completion

**Testing** (659 lines, 43 tests):

- **EvaluationEngineService Tests** (27 tests):
  - `evaluateCondition`: Success, not found, inactive, trace generation, complex expressions, missing variables, excessive depth, database errors, timing
  - `evaluateConditions`: Multiple conditions, empty list, partial failures, traces
  - Private methods: Validation, context building, variable extraction, variable resolution
- **Controller Tests** (16 tests updated):
  - Proper mocking of `EvaluationEngineService`
  - Verification of service delegation
  - JSON parsing error handling
  - Trace inclusion verification
- Type-safe private method testing via interface casting
- All tests using mocked Prisma for database operations
- Test-to-code ratio: 1.32:1 (excellent coverage)

**Key Features**:

- **Expression Validation**: Prevents null/undefined, requires valid object structure, enforces max depth (10 levels)
- **Security**: Max depth validation prevents recursion DoS attacks
- **Trace Generation**: Step-by-step debugging trace with input/output for each step
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing conditions, inactive conditions, invalid expressions, database failures
- **Variable Support**: Handles simple variables and nested property paths
- **Performance**: Tracks evaluation time per condition and batch operations

**Performance Characteristics**:

- Evaluation without I/O: <10ms per condition (meets success criteria)
- Database query per condition (acknowledged N+1, will optimize in Stage 5 with caching)
- Sequential batch evaluation (acknowledged, will optimize in Stage 4 with dependency graphs)

**Validation**:

- ✅ All 47 tests passing (43 service + controller, 4 interceptor)
- ✅ TypeScript type-check passing with no errors
- ✅ ESLint passing with no errors or warnings
- ✅ Code review approved with minor suggestions for future stages
- ✅ Test coverage: All public methods, all private methods, all error paths
- ✅ Performance <10ms per evaluation (without I/O)

**Code Quality Metrics**:

- Implementation: 498 lines
- Tests: 659 lines
- Test-to-code ratio: 1.32:1
- Test coverage: Comprehensive (all methods, all error paths, edge cases)

**Known Limitations (To Be Addressed):**

- Direct PrismaClient instantiation (should use DI, refactor in Stage 4+)
- Sequential batch evaluation (Stage 4 will add dependency-based ordering)
- N+1 database query pattern (Stage 5 will add caching)
- No dependency graph integration yet (Stage 4)

**Next Stage**: Stage 4 - Dependency Graph Integration
