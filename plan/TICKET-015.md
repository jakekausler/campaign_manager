# TICKET-015: Rules Engine Service Worker

## Status
- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:

## Description
Create a dedicated Node.js worker service for the rules engine that evaluates conditions, maintains dependency graphs, performs incremental recomputation, and communicates via gRPC/HTTP and Redis pub/sub.

## Scope of Work
1. Create rules-engine service package
2. Implement gRPC/HTTP API interface
3. Build evaluation engine
4. Implement incremental recomputation
5. Add Redis pub/sub for invalidations
6. Create caching layer
7. Add health checks and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rules engine runs as separate service
- [ ] API service can request rule evaluations
- [ ] Incremental recomputation on state changes
- [ ] Publishes invalidations via Redis
- [ ] Caches evaluation results
- [ ] Performance <50ms for typical evaluations

## Dependencies
- Requires: TICKET-014

## Estimated Effort
5-6 days
