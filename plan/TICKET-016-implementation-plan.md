# TICKET-016 Implementation Plan: Effect System

## Overview

Implement the Effect system that allows events/encounters to mutate world state or other entities when they resolve, with support for pre/post/onResolve timing.

## Background

The Effect model already exists in the schema (`packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma`) with basic fields. This ticket will:

1. Enhance the schema with timing support (pre/post/onResolve)
2. Implement effect execution engine with patch application
3. Create CRUD operations via GraphQL
4. Track effect execution history
5. Integrate with dependency graph for cycle detection

**Related Systems:**

- Condition System (TICKET-012): Provides JSONLogic evaluation infrastructure
- Dependency Graph (TICKET-014): Will track effect write dependencies
- Rules Engine (TICKET-015): May be used for optimized effect evaluation
- Event/Encounter models: Already exist with Effect relations

## Stages

### Stage 1: Database Schema Enhancement

**Goal**: Add timing field to Effect model and create EffectExecution audit model

**Tasks:**

- [x] Read existing Effect model in schema.prisma
- [x] Add `timing` enum field (PRE | ON_RESOLVE | POST) to Effect model
- [x] Create EffectExecution model for audit trail:
  - id, effectId, entityType, entityId (polymorphic to Encounter/Event)
  - executedAt (timestamp), executedBy (user)
  - context (JSON - entity state before execution)
  - result (JSON - patch applied + success status)
  - error (nullable string)
- [x] Generate Prisma migration
- [x] Run migration in development database
- [x] Regenerate Prisma client

**Success Criteria:**

- [x] Migration applies without errors
- [x] Effect model has timing field with proper enum constraint
- [x] EffectExecution model created with proper indexes
- [x] Prisma client regenerated with new types

**Testing:**

- Manual verification via Prisma Studio
- Migration rollback/reapply test

**Commit Message Template:**

```
feat(api): add effect timing and execution audit models

### Stage 2: GraphQL Type Definitions

**Goal**: Define GraphQL types for Effect operations and execution results

**Tasks:**

  - EffectExecutionObjectType
  - EffectExecutionResultType (success, patchApplied, error, executionId)

  - CreateEffectInput (name, description, effectType, payload, entityType, entityId, timing, priority)
  - UpdateEffectInput (partial fields + expectedVersion)
  - ExecuteEffectInput (effectId, context, dryRun?)
  - EffectWhereInput (filtering for queries)
  - EffectOrderByInput (sorting)

## Dependencies

- **TICKET-012** (Condition System): Provides JSONLogic evaluation patterns and authorization models
- **TICKET-014** (Dependency Graph): Required for tracking effect write dependencies and cycle detection
- **TICKET-015** (Rules Engine): Optional - may be used for optimized effect evaluation in future

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each service has comprehensive unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Resolvers and services tested with mocked dependencies
- **E2E Tests**: Full resolution workflows with real database
- **Manual Testing**: GraphQL playground for all operations

## Security Considerations

- **Path Whitelisting**: Only allow patches to safe entity fields (no IDs, timestamps, deletedAt)
- **Campaign Authorization**: All operations verify user has campaign access via entity relations
- **Role-Based Mutations**: Only owner/gm can create/update/delete effects
- **Audit Trail**: Complete execution history in EffectExecution records
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Prevent infinite effect loops via dependency graph

## Performance Considerations

- **Priority Ordering**: Effects execute in priority order within each timing phase
- **Dependency Ordering**: Use topological sort for optimal execution order
- **Batch Execution**: Execute multiple effects in single transaction where possible
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview effect results without database writes
- **Caching**: Leverage dependency graph cache for evaluation order

## Future Enhancements (Post-TICKET-016)

- **Conditional Effects**: Effects that only execute if a condition is met
- **Effect Templates**: Reusable effect patterns for common mutations
- **Effect Chains**: Explicit chaining with data passing between effects
- **Rollback Support**: Undo effect executions (inverse patches)
- **Effect Scheduler**: Time-delayed effect execution
- **Rules Engine Integration**: Use gRPC service for high-performance evaluation
- **Batch Operations**: Apply same effect to multiple entities
- **Effect Visualization**: Graph view of effect chains and dependencies

## Notes

- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all services
- Follow existing patterns from Condition System (TICKET-012)
- Delegate to specialized subagents:
  - TypeScript Fixer for type/lint errors
  - TypeScript Tester for running/debugging tests
  - Code Reviewer before each commit
  - Project Manager before ticket closure
- Commit after each stage completion
- Update this plan with commit hashes as stages complete
