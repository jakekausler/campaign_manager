# TICKET-016: Effect System Implementation

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - Stage 1: 7d1439d (Database Schema Enhancement)

## Description

Implement the Effect system that allows events/encounters to mutate world state or other entities when they resolve, with support for pre/post/onResolve timing.

## Scope of Work

1. Create Effect CRUD operations
2. Implement effect execution engine
3. Add timing support (pre/post/onResolve)
4. Create effect patch application
5. Track effect execution history
6. Integrate with dependency graph

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can create effects on events/encounters
- [ ] Effects execute at correct timing
- [ ] Patch JSON correctly updates target entities
- [ ] Effect execution creates audit trail
- [ ] Effects can trigger other effects
- [ ] Circular effect dependencies detected

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-012, TICKET-015

## Estimated Effort

3-4 days

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Database Schema Enhancement (7d1439d)

**Completed**: Database schema successfully enhanced with effect timing and execution audit trail.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectTiming` enum with three execution phases: PRE, ON_RESOLVE, POST
- Added `timing` field to Effect model (default: ON_RESOLVE)
- Added `version` field to Effect model for optimistic locking
- Created `EffectExecution` model with comprehensive audit fields:
  - Foreign key to Effect with CASCADE delete
  - Polymorphic reference to triggering entity (entityType/entityId)
  - User tracking (executedBy)
  - Complete audit context (entity state snapshot before execution)
  - Execution results (patch applied, success status, affected fields)
  - Error messages for failed executions

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Composite index on Effect(entityType, entityId, timing) for efficient phase-based queries
- Composite index on EffectExecution(entityType, entityId, executedAt) for audit trail pagination
- Individual indexes on all foreign keys and common query fields

**Migration Handling:**

- Properly handled Location GIST index (Prisma limitation - must drop and recreate in each migration)
- All indexes created for optimal query performance

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing Location GIST index issue and adding composite index for audit trail queries.
