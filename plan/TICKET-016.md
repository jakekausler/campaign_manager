# TICKET-016: Effect System Implementation

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - Stage 1: 7d1439d (Database Schema Enhancement)
  - Stage 2: e125476 (GraphQL Type Definitions)
  - Stage 3: c88a40d (Effect Patch Application Service)

## Description

Implement the Effect system that allows events/encounters to mutate world state or other entities when they resolve, with support for pre/post/onResolve timing.

## Scope of Work

1. Create Effect CRUD operations
2. Implement effect execution engine
3. Add timing support (pre/post/onResolve)
4. Create effect patch application
5. Track effect execution history
6. Integrate with dependency graph

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can create effects on events/encounters
- [ ] Effects execute at correct timing
- [ ] Patch JSON correctly updates target entities
- [ ] Effect execution creates audit trail
- [ ] Effects can trigger other effects
- [ ] Circular effect dependencies detected

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-012, TICKET-015

## Estimated Effort

3-4 days

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Database Schema Enhancement (7d1439d)

**Completed**: Database schema successfully enhanced with effect timing and execution audit trail.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectTiming` enum with three execution phases: PRE, ON_RESOLVE, POST
- Added `timing` field to Effect model (default: ON_RESOLVE)
- Added `version` field to Effect model for optimistic locking
- Created `EffectExecution` model with comprehensive audit fields:
  - Foreign key to Effect with CASCADE delete
  - Polymorphic reference to triggering entity (entityType/entityId)
  - User tracking (executedBy)
  - Complete audit context (entity state snapshot before execution)
  - Execution results (patch applied, success status, affected fields)
  - Error messages for failed executions

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Composite index on Effect(entityType, entityId, timing) for efficient phase-based queries
- Composite index on EffectExecution(entityType, entityId, executedAt) for audit trail pagination
- Individual indexes on all foreign keys and common query fields

**Migration Handling:**

- Properly handled Location GIST index (Prisma limitation - must drop and recreate in each migration)
- All indexes created for optimal query performance

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing Location GIST index issue and adding composite index for audit trail queries.

### Stage 2: GraphQL Type Definitions (e125476)

**Completed**: GraphQL type system successfully created for effect operations and execution results.

**Changes Made:**

- Created comprehensive type definitions in `effect.type.ts`:
  - `EffectTiming` enum (PRE, ON_RESOLVE, POST) with detailed descriptions
  - `EffectEntityType` enum (ENCOUNTER, EVENT)
  - `Effect` object type matching Prisma model with all fields
  - `EffectExecution` object type for audit trail
  - `EffectExecutionResult` type for individual execution outcomes
  - `EffectExecutionSummary` type for bulk execution results

- Created comprehensive input types in `effect.input.ts`:
  - `CreateEffectInput` with full validation (@MaxLength, @IsEnum, @IsString)
  - `UpdateEffectInput` with optimistic locking via expectedVersion
  - `ExecuteEffectInput` with dry-run support and optional context
  - `ExecuteEffectsForEntityInput` for bulk execution by timing phase
  - `EffectWhereInput` and `EffectOrderByInput` for flexible querying
  - `EffectExecutionWhereInput` and `EffectExecutionOrderByInput` for execution history

**Key Features:**

- Comprehensive validation decorators (class-validator)
- CUID-compatible ID validation (@IsString instead of @IsUUID)
- RFC 6902 JSON Patch documentation on payload fields
- Max 100KB payload size documented
- Context auto-loading when omitted in ExecuteEffectInput
- Optimistic locking support via version field
- Soft delete support via deletedAt
- Priority-based execution ordering

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing:

1. Added @MaxLength(500) to description fields
2. Fixed UUID validation to use @IsString for CUID compatibility
3. Added payload validation documentation (max size, EffectPatchService validation)
4. Clarified context loading behavior in ExecuteEffectInput
5. Enhanced payload field documentation with RFC 6902 reference

### Stage 3: Effect Patch Application Service (c88a40d)

**Completed**: Core patch application service successfully implemented with comprehensive security validation.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectPatchService` in `effect-patch.service.ts`:
  - `validatePatch()` - Validates JSON Patch format and enforces path whitelisting
  - `applyPatch()` - Applies patches immutably using fast-json-patch library
  - `generatePatchPreview()` - Generates before/after diffs with changed field detection

- Security Features:
  - Protected field whitelisting (id, createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt, version)
  - Entity-specific protection (Settlement: campaignId/kingdomId/locationId, Structure: settlementId, Kingdom: campaignId, etc.)
  - Validates all RFC 6902 operations (add, remove, replace, copy, move, test)
  - Rejects operations on protected fields before application

- Performance Optimizations:
  - Uses native `structuredClone()` for fast, safe deep cloning (handles Date objects, circular refs)
  - Enhanced `deepEqual()` with Date object comparison support
  - Early validation prevents unnecessary patch attempts

- Created comprehensive test suite (`effect-patch.service.test.ts`):
  - 51 unit tests covering all operations and edge cases
  - Patch format validation (missing fields, invalid operations)
  - Path whitelisting for Settlement, Structure, Kingdom entities
  - Immutability verification (original entities unchanged)
  - Nested path and array operation handling
  - Error handling for validation and application failures
  - Preview generation with accurate change detection

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Native structuredClone()**: Replaced `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for better performance and proper Date/circular reference handling
2. **Path Whitelisting**: Uses allowlist approach (secure by default) rather than blocklist
3. **Immutable Operations**: All patch operations create new objects without modifying originals
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed validation errors with specific field paths for debugging

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing:

1. Replaced `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` with `structuredClone()` for better performance and Date support
2. Enhanced `deepEqual()` to handle Date objects properly using `getTime()` comparison
3. Added clarifying comments to `applyPatch()` method explaining boolean parameters (validate, mutateDocument)

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 51 tests pass
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes with no new warnings
- ✅ Test coverage > 90%
