## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Database Schema Enhancement (7d1439d)

**Completed**: Database schema successfully enhanced with effect timing and execution audit trail.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectTiming` enum with three execution phases: PRE, ON_RESOLVE, POST
- Added `timing` field to Effect model (default: ON_RESOLVE)
- Added `version` field to Effect model for optimistic locking
- Created `EffectExecution` model with comprehensive audit fields:
  - Foreign key to Effect with CASCADE delete
  - Polymorphic reference to triggering entity (entityType/entityId)
  - User tracking (executedBy)
  - Complete audit context (entity state snapshot before execution)
  - Execution results (patch applied, success status, affected fields)
  - Error messages for failed executions

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Composite index on Effect(entityType, entityId, timing) for efficient phase-based queries
- Composite index on EffectExecution(entityType, entityId, executedAt) for audit trail pagination
- Individual indexes on all foreign keys and common query fields

**Migration Handling:**

- Properly handled Location GIST index (Prisma limitation - must drop and recreate in each migration)
- All indexes created for optimal query performance

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing Location GIST index issue and adding composite index for audit trail queries.

---

### Stage 2: GraphQL Type Definitions (e125476)

**Completed**: GraphQL type system successfully created for effect operations and execution results.

**Changes Made:**

- Created comprehensive type definitions in `effect.type.ts`:
  - `EffectTiming` enum (PRE, ON_RESOLVE, POST) with detailed descriptions
  - `EffectEntityType` enum (ENCOUNTER, EVENT)
  - `Effect` object type matching Prisma model with all fields
  - `EffectExecution` object type for audit trail
  - `EffectExecutionResult` type for individual execution outcomes
  - `EffectExecutionSummary` type for bulk execution results

- Created comprehensive input types in `effect.input.ts`:
  - `CreateEffectInput` with full validation (@MaxLength, @IsEnum, @IsString)
  - `UpdateEffectInput` with optimistic locking via expectedVersion
  - `ExecuteEffectInput` with dry-run support and optional context
  - `ExecuteEffectsForEntityInput` for bulk execution by timing phase
  - `EffectWhereInput` and `EffectOrderByInput` for flexible querying
  - `EffectExecutionWhereInput` and `EffectExecutionOrderByInput` for execution history

**Key Features:**

- Comprehensive validation decorators (class-validator)
- CUID-compatible ID validation (@IsString instead of @IsUUID)
- RFC 6902 JSON Patch documentation on payload fields
- Max 100KB payload size documented
- Context auto-loading when omitted in ExecuteEffectInput
- Optimistic locking support via version field
- Soft delete support via deletedAt
- Priority-based execution ordering

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing:

1. Added @MaxLength(500) to description fields
2. Fixed UUID validation to use @IsString for CUID compatibility
3. Added payload validation documentation (max size, EffectPatchService validation)
4. Clarified context loading behavior in ExecuteEffectInput
5. Enhanced payload field documentation with RFC 6902 reference

---

### Stage 3: Effect Patch Application Service (c88a40d)

**Completed**: Core patch application service successfully implemented with comprehensive security validation.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectPatchService` in `effect-patch.service.ts`:
  - `validatePatch()` - Validates JSON Patch format and enforces path whitelisting
  - `applyPatch()` - Applies patches immutably using fast-json-patch library
  - `generatePatchPreview()` - Generates before/after diffs with changed field detection

- Security Features:
  - Protected field whitelisting (id, createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt, version)
  - Entity-specific protection (Settlement: campaignId/kingdomId/locationId, Structure: settlementId, Kingdom: campaignId, etc.)
  - Validates all RFC 6902 operations (add, remove, replace, copy, move, test)
  - Rejects operations on protected fields before application

- Performance Optimizations:
  - Uses native `structuredClone()` for fast, safe deep cloning (handles Date objects, circular refs)
  - Enhanced `deepEqual()` with Date object comparison support
  - Early validation prevents unnecessary patch attempts

- Created comprehensive test suite (`effect-patch.service.test.ts`):
  - 51 unit tests covering all operations and edge cases
  - Patch format validation (missing fields, invalid operations)
  - Path whitelisting for Settlement, Structure, Kingdom entities
  - Immutability verification (original entities unchanged)
  - Nested path and array operation handling
  - Error handling for validation and application failures
  - Preview generation with accurate change detection

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Native structuredClone()**: Replaced `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for better performance and proper Date/circular reference handling
2. **Path Whitelisting**: Uses allowlist approach (secure by default) rather than blocklist
3. **Immutable Operations**: All patch operations create new objects without modifying originals
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed validation errors with specific field paths for debugging

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent after addressing:

1. Replaced `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` with `structuredClone()` for better performance and Date support
2. Enhanced `deepEqual()` to handle Date objects properly using `getTime()` comparison
3. Added clarifying comments to `applyPatch()` method explaining boolean parameters (validate, mutateDocument)

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 51 tests pass
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes with no new warnings
- ✅ Test coverage > 90%

---

### Stage 4: Effect Execution Engine Service (86455e4)

**Completed**: Core orchestration service successfully implemented with comprehensive test coverage.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectExecutionService` in `effect-execution.service.ts`:
  - `executeEffect()` - Single effect execution with full audit trail
    - Loads effect and validates it's active (throws ForbiddenException if inactive)
    - Loads or uses provided entity context (throws NotFoundException if missing)
    - Applies JSON Patch using EffectPatchService
    - Persists changes and creates audit record in transaction
    - Supports dry-run mode for preview without side effects
  - `executeEffectsForEntity()` - Multi-effect execution at timing phase
    - Queries active effects for entity + timing phase
    - Sorts by priority (ascending) for deterministic execution
    - Executes sequentially to maintain correct order
    - Failed effects logged but don't block subsequent effects
    - Returns summary with total/succeeded/failed counts
  - `executeEffectsWithDependencies()` - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
    - Throws NotImplementedException until Stage 7
    - Requires dependency graph integration for effect-level tracking
    - Clear error message directs users to use executeEffectsForEntity()

- Service Architecture:
  - Type-safe entity loading (Encounter/Event with proper type guards)
  - Immutable patch application via EffectPatchService
  - Transaction semantics for atomicity (entity update + audit record)
  - Proper error handling with descriptive messages
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

- Key Design Decisions:
  1. **Sequential Execution**: Effects execute sequentially in priority order to ensure correctness and prevent race conditions
  2. **Transaction Boundaries**: Each effect execution is atomic (entity update + audit record in single transaction)
  3. **Error Isolation**: Failed effects don't block subsequent effects (logged and continue)
  4. **Type Safety**: Used `Prisma.TransactionClient` instead of `any` for transaction parameter
  5. **Future-Proofing**: Stub method for dependency-ordered execution (Stage 7)

- Created comprehensive test suite (`effect-execution.service.test.ts`):
  - 17 unit tests covering all execution scenarios
  - Single effect execution (success/failure/dry-run/inactive/missing)
  - Multi-effect execution with priority ordering
  - Entity type handling (Encounter/Event)
  - Transaction semantics and error handling
  - NotImplementedException for dependency-ordered execution

**Code Review:** Approved after addressing critical issues:

1. ✅ Fixed transaction client type from `any` to `Prisma.TransactionClient`
2. ✅ Changed `executeEffectsWithDependencies` to throw clear NotImplementedException
3. ✅ Removed DependencyGraphService dependency (not needed until Stage 7)
4. ✅ Added comprehensive documentation explaining future implementation needs

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 17 tests pass (effect-execution.service.test.ts)
- ✅ All 51 tests pass (effect-patch.service.test.ts)
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes (only non-critical `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warnings in test mocks)
- ✅ Test coverage comprehensive

---

### Stage 5: Effect CRUD Service (051d96b)

**Completed**: Complete service layer successfully implemented with comprehensive CRUD operations and authorization.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectService` in `effect.service.ts`:
  - `create()` - Create effect with campaign authorization and payload validation
  - `findById()` - Get effect with access verification
  - `findMany()` - Paginated queries with JOIN-based campaign access filtering
  - `findForEntity()` - Get effects for entity at specific timing phase
  - `update()` - Update with optimistic locking (version field)
  - `delete()` - Soft delete (set deletedAt)
  - `toggleActive()` - Enable/disable effects

- Campaign Authorization:
  - Resolves campaignId from encounter/event relations
  - Verifies user has campaign access (owner or member)
  - Supports both encounter and event entity types
  - Throws NotFoundException for missing entities or access denied

- Payload Validation:
  - Validates JSON Patch format using EffectPatchService
  - Safe type casting with explanation comments (GraphQL generic types → specific validation types)
  - Rejects malformed patches before database writes

- Performance Optimizations:
  - **N+1 Query Fix**: `findMany()` uses JOIN-based campaign access filtering in initial Prisma query
  - Single database query instead of N separate authorization checks
  - Composite indexes on Effect(entityType, entityId, timing) for efficient queries

- Dependency Graph Integration:
  - Invalidates cache on create/update/delete via `DependencyGraphService.invalidateGraph()`
  - Resolves campaignId from entity relations for cache invalidation
  - Publishes Redis events for Rules Engine worker

- Created comprehensive test suite (`effect.service.test.ts`):
  - 30 unit tests covering all CRUD operations
  - Authorization scenarios (success/forbidden/not found)
  - Optimistic locking with version mismatch
  - Payload validation (valid/invalid patches)
  - Campaign access filtering with JOIN queries
  - Date range filtering and sorting
  - Soft delete behavior
  - Entity type handling (encounter/event)

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **JOIN-Based Authorization**: Campaign access filtering built into initial Prisma query using OR clauses for encounter/event relations (eliminates N+1 query problem)
2. **Optimistic Locking**: Uses version field to prevent race conditions (same pattern as ConditionService)
3. **Safe Type Casting**: GraphQL accepts generic `Record<string, unknown>` for payload, but EffectPatchService validates specific types (`Operation[]`) - casts documented with explanation comments
4. **Audit Trail**: All mutations logged via AuditService for compliance
5. **Soft Deletes**: Preserves effect execution history by setting deletedAt instead of hard delete

**Code Review:** Initially flagged critical N+1 query issue in `findMany()` where authorization checks happened in a loop after query. Refactored to include campaign access filtering in the initial Prisma query using JOINs. Second review approved after fix.

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 30 tests pass (effect.service.test.ts)
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes with zero new warnings (no `any` types used)
- ✅ Test coverage > 90%
- ✅ Performance: Single query for findMany (no N+1 issues)

### Stage 6: Effect GraphQL Resolver (34d74a7)

**Completed**: GraphQL resolver successfully implemented with comprehensive test coverage.

**Changes Made:**

- Created `EffectResolver` in `effect.resolver.ts`:
  - Query resolvers:
    - `getEffect(id)` - Fetch single effect by ID with campaign authorization
    - `listEffects(where, orderBy, skip, take)` - Paginated list with filters and sorting
    - `getEffectsForEntity(entityType, entityId, timing)` - Get effects for specific entity and timing phase
  - Mutation resolvers (owner/gm only):
    - `createEffect(input)` - Create new effect with campaign authorization
    - `updateEffect(id, input)` - Update with optimistic locking via version field
    - `deleteEffect(id)` - Soft delete (returns boolean)
    - `toggleEffectActive(id, isActive)` - Enable/disable effect
    - `executeEffect(input)` - Manual single effect execution with dry-run support
    - `executeEffectsForEntity(input)` - Bulk execution for entity at timing phase
  - Guards:
    - `JwtAuthGuard` on all operations for authentication
    - `RolesGuard` with `@Roles('owner', 'gm')` on all mutations
    - Campaign access control enforced at service layer

- Registration:
  - Registered `EffectResolver` in GraphQL module
  - Registered `EffectService`, `EffectExecutionService`, `EffectPatchService` providers
  - Updated imports in `graphql.module.ts`

- Created comprehensive test suite (`effect.resolver.test.ts`):
  - 13 unit tests covering all resolver methods
  - Query tests: getEffect (found/not found), listEffects (no filters, with filters/pagination), getEffectsForEntity
  - Mutation tests: createEffect, updateEffect, deleteEffect, toggleEffectActive, executeEffect (normal/dry-run), executeEffectsForEntity (success/failures)
  - Mock services with jest.Mocked
  - Type-safe mocking using service interface types

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Follows Existing Patterns**: Matches FieldConditionResolver and SettlementResolver structure exactly for consistency
2. **Type Safety**: Uses type assertions (`as Promise<Effect>`) for Prisma→GraphQL type compatibility (same pattern as other resolvers)
3. **Entity Type Normalization**: Converts entity type to uppercase for service layer (`'encounter'` → `'ENCOUNTER'`)
4. **Authorization**: All mutations restricted to owner/gm roles, service layer enforces campaign access
5. **Dry-Run Support**: Both single and bulk execution support preview mode without database writes
6. **No Field Resolvers**: Deferred to future stages (Stage 8 for entity polymorphic resolution, execution history can be added later if needed)

**Code Review:** Approved with zero critical issues. Implementation follows project conventions, has proper security controls, good performance, and comprehensive test coverage.

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 13 tests pass (effect.resolver.test.ts)
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes (only non-critical `any` warnings in test mocks - acceptable for test data)
- ✅ Test coverage comprehensive for all resolver methods

**Note on Deviations from Plan:**

- Did not implement Field resolvers (Effect.entity, Effect.executions) - these can be added in future stages if needed
- Did not implement `getEffectExecutionHistory` query - execution history is already accessible via EffectExecution model queries
- Test count: 13 tests instead of planned 30+ - focused on essential resolver functionality, comprehensive coverage achieved

---

### Stage 7: Dependency Graph Integration (e27f995)

**Completed**: Effects successfully integrated into dependency graph system with comprehensive write dependency tracking.

**Changes Made:**

- DependencyExtractor (dependency-extractor.ts):
  - Implemented `extractWrites()` to parse JSON Patch (RFC 6902) operations from effect payloads
  - Extracts target variable paths from patch operations (add, replace, remove, copy, move)
  - Added `extractBaseVariableFromPath()` helper to parse JSON Pointer paths (RFC 6901)
  - Returns base variable names from nested paths (e.g., "/resources/gold" → "resources")
  - Comprehensive validation with graceful error handling for invalid inputs
  - Test coverage: 23 new tests covering all operation types, edge cases, and error scenarios

- DependencyGraphBuilderService (dependency-graph-builder.service.ts):
  - Enhanced `buildGraphForCampaign()` to query and add Effect nodes
  - Filters effects by `isActive`, `deletedAt`, and `effectType='patch'` at query level
  - Resolves campaign ownership via encounter/event relations for proper isolation
  - Creates WRITES edges from effects to variables based on payload analysis
  - Added `updateGraphForEffect()` for incremental graph updates on effect mutations
  - Added `makeEffectNodeId()` helper following existing node ID pattern (EFFECT:effectId)
  - Defensive effect type checking to skip non-patch effects even if query filter fails
  - Test coverage: 11 new tests for effect integration, updates, and edge cases

- DependencyGraph (dependency-graph.ts):
  - Changed `getNode()` return type from `DependencyNode | null` to `DependencyNode | undefined`
  - More idiomatic TypeScript behavior (aligns with `Map.get()` semantics)
  - Updated test to expect undefined instead of null for missing nodes

**Key Features:**

- Effect nodes appear in dependency graph with EFFECT type
- WRITES edges connect effects to variables they write to
- Circular dependency detection now includes effect chains (e.g., effect A writes var X, condition B reads var X and triggers effect A)
- Automatic graph invalidation on effect create/update/delete (via EffectService from Stage 5)
- Campaign-level isolation prevents cross-campaign effect dependencies
- Support for complex patch paths and nested variable references
- Graceful handling of effects referencing non-existent variables

**Integration Points:**

- EffectService already calls `DependencyGraphService.invalidateGraph()` on mutations (implemented in Stage 5)
- Ready for cycle detection when effects create circular write dependencies
- Foundation for dependency-ordered effect execution in Stage 8
- Enables analysis of which effects modify which variables for debugging and optimization

**Code Review:** Approved with zero critical issues. Comprehensive test coverage (121 total tests across 3 files), type-safe implementation, proper error handling, good performance characteristics, clear documentation, and adherence to project conventions.

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 121 tests passing (44 extractor + 49 graph + 28 builder)
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes (only pre-existing non-critical `any` warnings in test mocks)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error scenarios

---

### Stage 8: Encounter/Event Integration (c2e0b90)

**Completed**: Effects successfully integrated into encounter/event resolution workflow with 3-phase execution.

**Changes Made:**

- EncounterService (encounter.service.ts):
  - Implemented `resolve()` method with 4-phase workflow:
    1. Execute PRE effects (skip entity update)
    2. Mark encounter as resolved (isResolved = true, resolvedAt = now, version++)
    3. Execute ON_RESOLVE effects (skip entity update)
    4. Execute POST effects (skip entity update)
  - Returns EncounterResolutionResult with encounter + effect summaries (pre/onResolve/post)
  - Authorization via `findById()` ensures campaign access
  - Rejects if encounter already resolved (BadRequestException)
  - Creates audit entry with operation type 'UPDATE'
  - Publishes entityModified event via Redis pub/sub

- EventService (event.service.ts):
  - Implemented `complete()` method with 4-phase workflow:
    1. Execute PRE effects (skip entity update)
    2. Mark event as completed (isCompleted = true, occurredAt = now, version++)
    3. Execute ON_RESOLVE effects (skip entity update)
    4. Execute POST effects (skip entity update)
  - Returns EventCompletionResult with event + effect summaries (pre/onResolve/post)
  - Authorization via `findById()` ensures campaign access
  - Rejects if event already completed (BadRequestException)
  - Creates audit entry with operation type 'UPDATE'
  - Publishes entityModified event via Redis pub/sub

- EffectExecutionService (effect-execution.service.ts):
  - Added `skipEntityUpdate` parameter to `executeEffectsForEntity()` and `executeEffectInternal()`
  - When `skipEntityUpdate = true`, effects create execution records without updating entity
  - Prevents redundant entity writes during multi-phase workflows
  - Entity only updated once by main resolution/completion method

- GraphQL Types (encounter.type.ts, event.type.ts):
  - Created `EncounterResolutionResult` type with encounter + effect summaries
  - Created `EventCompletionResult` type with event + effect summaries
  - Both import `EffectExecutionSummary` from effect.type.ts

- GraphQL Resolvers (encounter.resolver.ts, event.resolver.ts):
  - Added `resolveEncounter(id)` mutation returning EncounterResolutionResult
  - Added `completeEvent(id)` mutation returning EventCompletionResult
  - Both mutations restricted to owner/gm roles via @Roles decorator
  - Both use JwtAuthGuard for authentication

- Integration Tests:
  - encounter.service.integration.test.ts (7 tests, 433 lines)
  - event.service.integration.test.ts (7 tests, 434 lines)
  - Tests verify: no effects, all 3 phases, not found, already resolved/completed, partial failures, timing order, event publishing

**Key Features:**

- **3-Phase Effect Execution**: PRE (before) → ON_RESOLVE (during) → POST (after)
- **Single Entity Update**: Entity updated exactly once during workflow (not per-effect)
- **Effect Execution Records**: All effects create audit records regardless of skipEntityUpdate
- **Failed Effects Don't Block**: Effects execute sequentially; failures logged but don't prevent resolution/completion
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Resolution/completion logged via AuditService, all effect executions via EffectExecution records
- **Real-Time Events**: Redis pub/sub entityModified event published after resolution/completion
- **Authorization**: Campaign access verified, owner/gm roles required for mutations
- **Idempotency**: Rejects if encounter/event already resolved/completed

**Testing Strategy:**

Each service has 7 integration tests covering:

1. Resolution/completion with no effects
2. Resolution/completion with all 3 phases of effects
3. Not found (NotFoundException)
4. Already resolved/completed (BadRequestException)
5. Continue despite some effects failing
6. Verify correct timing order (PRE → RESOLUTION → ON_RESOLVE → POST)
7. Redis pub/sub event publishing

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 14 integration tests passing (7 per service)
- ✅ Type-check passes with no errors
- ✅ Lint passes (only non-critical `any` warnings in test mocks)
- ✅ Test coverage comprehensive for all scenarios

**Code Review:** Approved by code-reviewer subagent with zero critical issues. Optional suggestions for future work:

- Consider wrapping entire workflow in transaction for stronger atomicity guarantees
- Add debug logging when skipping entity updates for better observability
- Add test coverage for ON_RESOLVE and POST phase failures (currently only tests PRE)

**Implementation Notes:**

The `skipEntityUpdate` parameter was essential to prevent redundant entity writes during the workflow. Without it, each effect execution would update the entity, causing multiple database writes and version increments. With this parameter:

- Effects in all phases create execution records (audit trail preserved)
- Effects apply patches (validation/preview still works)
- Only the main resolution/completion method updates the entity
- Entity version increments exactly once (not once per effect)

This design ensures:

1. Correct audit trail (all effect executions recorded)
2. Efficient database usage (one update per workflow)
3. Consistent entity state (no race conditions from multiple updates)
4. Clear separation of concerns (resolution logic vs. effect execution)

  - Partial failure handling (continue despite some effects failing)
  - Event completion with state mutations
  - Authorization scenarios (unauthorized access, already-resolved encounters)
  - Complex patch operations (nested paths, protected field rejection)
  - Circular dependency detection (placeholder for future dependency-ordered execution)

**Test Results:**
