## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript (Completed)

**Changes Made**:

- Created separate `App.tsx` component with an interactive counter button to test hot reload functionality
- Updated `main.tsx` to import App component, following proper separation of concerns
- Enhanced `vite.config.ts` with:
  - Path alias configuration (`@/*` -> `./src/*`) for cleaner imports
  - Build optimizations including vendor chunking (React/ReactDOM separated for better caching)
  - Sourcemap generation for debugging
  - Network-friendly server config (`host: true`, `strictPort: false`) for Docker compatibility
- Updated `tsconfig.json`:
  - Added path alias support matching Vite config
  - Removed restrictive `rootDir` option to allow compilation of root-level config files (vite.config.ts)
  - Included `vite.config.ts` in compilation
- Updated `package.json`:
  - Added TypeScript as dev dependency (explicit type support)
  - Added `@types/node` for Node.js built-in module types (required for path alias resolution)
  - Maintained alphabetical ordering in devDependencies

**Technical Decisions**:

- Used `@/*` alias pattern instead of `@campaign/frontend/*` to distinguish frontend-specific paths from workspace packages
- Implemented vendor chunking strategy to separate React libraries from application code for optimal caching
- Enabled sourcemaps to support debugging in development and production
- Used `host: true` in Vite config for Docker/network accessibility

**Success Verification**:
✅ Dev server starts successfully on port 3000 (tested with timeout command)
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ ESLint passes with no errors
✅ Hot reload functionality works (verified via counter button component)
✅ Path alias system configured and ready for use

**Next Steps**: Stage 2 will add Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for styling and component primitives.

  - Enables conditional styling and proper class deduplication

shadcn/ui Components:

- Created `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  - 6 variants: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link
  - 4 size options: default, sm, lg, icon
  - Uses `class-variance-authority` for type-safe variant props
  - Supports `asChild` prop via Radix UI Slot primitive
- Created `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
  - Complete card component system: Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter

- `lucide-react@^0.469.0`

**Technical Decisions**:

- Used Tailwind CSS v3.4.18 instead of v4 for compatibility with standard shadcn/ui patterns and PostCSS configuration
- Chose HSL color format for theme variables to enable easy color manipulation and accessibility improvements
- Implemented Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled base components following WAI-ARIA patterns
- Used `class-variance-authority` for type-safe variant management with IntelliSense support
- Created manual shadcn/ui components instead of using CLI to maintain monorepo compatibility
- Configured dark mode support via class strategy for future implementation

**Success Verification**:

**Next Steps**: Stage 3 will configure ESLint and Prettier for the frontend package.

---

### Stage 3: Configure ESLint and Prettier (Completed)

**Changes Made**:

ESLint Configuration:

- Added `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^6.10.2` for automated accessibility checks
- Enhanced `.eslintrc.json` with:
  - `plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended` ruleset for comprehensive accessibility validation
  - `react/prop-types: off` (using TypeScript for type checking instead)
  - `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks: error` (enforce React Hooks rules)
  - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: warn` (warn on missing effect dependencies)
  - `jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid` configured for React Router Link component
- Maintains inheritance from root ESLint config for monorepo consistency

Prettier Configuration:

- Added `format` script: `prettier --write "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}"`
- Added `format:check` script: `prettier --check "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}"`
- Uses root `.prettierrc.json` configuration (semi, single quotes, 100 char width, etc.)
- Scripts alphabetically ordered in package.json for consistency

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed `CardTitle` component in `src/components/ui/card.tsx`:
  - Changed `React.forwardRef` generic type from `HTMLParagraphElement` to `HTMLHeadingElement`
  - Explicitly destructured and rendered `children` prop within `<h3>` element
  - Resolves `jsx-a11y/heading-has-content` accessibility error

**Technical Decisions**:

- Used `jsx-a11y/recommended` preset for industry-standard accessibility validation
- Kept `prop-types` rule disabled since TypeScript provides superior type safety
- Set `exhaustive-deps` to "warn" instead of "error" to allow flexibility for experienced developers
- Configured `jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid` to recognize React Router's `Link` component with `to` prop
- Target only relevant file extensions (ts, tsx, css) in format scripts for optimal performance

**Success Verification**:
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ ESLint passes with all accessibility checks enabled (0 errors, 0 warnings)
✅ Prettier formatting is consistent across all source files
✅ All quality scripts work correctly (lint, format, format:check, type-check)
✅ Pre-commit hooks successfully validate code quality
✅ CardTitle component properly handles children for screen readers

**Next Steps**: Stage 4 will create the organized folder structure for components, pages, hooks, utils, and services.

---

### Stage 4: Create Folder Structure (Completed)

**Changes Made**:

Directory Structure:

- Created `src/components/` subdirectories: `features/`, `layout/` (ui/ already existed)
- Created `src/pages/` for route components
- Created `src/hooks/` for custom React hooks
- Created `src/utils/` for pure utility functions

**Route Structure:**

```
/ (MainLayout)
├── / (HomePage)
└── /dashboard (DashboardPage, protected)

/auth (AuthLayout)
├── /auth (redirects to /auth/login)
└── /auth/login (LoginPage)

* (NotFoundPage - catch-all)
```

**Code Splitting Verification:**

Build output shows excellent code splitting:

- `vendor-DwRht5Uu.js`: 140.91 KB (React, React Router, Radix UI)
- `index-Blq5cfrh.js`: 147.55 KB (main bundle)
- `NotFoundPage-BvyK-Xph.js`: 0.81 KB
- `HomePage-HafeDMGt.js`: 1.61 KB
- `LoginPage-akdT5sX2.js`: 1.82 KB

- Active link highlighting provides visual feedback for current location

**Security Considerations:**

- Mock auth includes prominent warnings about insecurity
- Detailed JWT validation requirements documented in ProtectedRoute
- Comments emphasize need to validate token signature, expiry, and claims
- No sensitive operations in client-side auth logic (appropriate for demo)

**Accessibility:**

- PageLoader has role="status" and aria-label="Loading page"
- Input fields use focus-visible for keyboard-only focus indicators
- All forms have proper label associations
- Semantic HTML with correct heading hierarchy
- Interactive elements are keyboard accessible

**Success Verification:**

✅ Dev server starts successfully (tested with timeout)
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ ESLint passes with no warnings
✅ Build produces separate chunks for each page
✅ All routes navigate correctly
✅ Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
✅ Post-login redirect preserves intended destination

  - Stops retrying on auth failures (codes 4000+)
  - Prevents infinite loops on permanent errors
- Cache-first fetch policy for optimal performance
  - watchQuery uses cache-and-network (serves cache while fetching fresh data)
  - Regular query uses cache-first (serves from cache if available)
  - Comments explain when to override to network-only
- Empty typePolicies object ready for future cache customization

Environment Configuration Updates:
