# TICKET-018: State Management & GraphQL Client

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:

## Description

Set up global state management with Zustand and GraphQL client (Apollo Client or urql) with code generation from schema.

## Scope of Work

1. Install and configure Zustand for state management
2. Set up Apollo Client / urql with GraphQL endpoint
3. Configure GraphQL Code Generator
4. Create auth state management (token storage, user context)
5. Create campaign context state (current campaign, branch, asOf time)
6. Implement query hooks and mutation helpers
7. GraphQL hooks for Settlement and Structure types (useSettlementsByKingdom, useStructuresBySettlement, useSettlementDetails, useStructureDetails)
8. Add optimistic updates
9. Set up cache policies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GraphQL client connects to API
- [ ] Generated types match schema
- [ ] Auth token persists and auto-attaches
- [ ] Campaign context is globally accessible
- [ ] Queries use generated hooks
- [ ] Mutations update cache correctly
- [ ] Optimistic updates work
- [ ] Settlement GraphQL hooks work correctly
- [ ] Structure GraphQL hooks work correctly
- [ ] Can query Settlements by Kingdom via hooks
- [ ] Can query Structures by Settlement via hooks

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-005, TICKET-017

## Technical Notes

**Cache Policies for Settlement/Structure Relationships:**

- Settlement queries should be cached by Kingdom ID and settlement ID
- Structure queries should be cached by Settlement ID and structure ID
- Implement proper cache normalization for nested relationships
- Use cache-and-network policy for Settlement/Structure lists to ensure fresh data
- Configure cache eviction policies for paginated Settlement/Structure results

## Estimated Effort

2-3 days
