## Notes

- MapLibre GL JS is an open-source fork of Mapbox GL JS, compatible with Mapbox styles
- Consider using OpenStreetMap or other free basemap tiles
- PostGIS geometry needs conversion to GeoJSON (may require backend changes)
- World coordinates use SRID 3857 (Web Mercator projection)
- GraphQL queries should be optimized to fetch only needed fields
- Layer rendering order matters (regions -> points -> settlements -> structures)
- Consider implementing debouncing for time scrubber to avoid excessive queries

## Dependencies

- Backend TICKET-008 (Locations and Regions) must be complete
- Backend TICKET-018 (State Management & GraphQL Client) must be complete
- May need backend enhancements for geometry-to-GeoJSON conversion

## Estimated Total Time

4-5 days across 13 stages
