## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Install Dependencies and Basic Setup (Commit: 069050c)

**What was implemented:**

- Installed maplibre-gl (^5.9.0) and @types/maplibre-gl for TypeScript support
- Created basic Map component in `packages/frontend/src/components/features/map/Map.tsx`
- Map component includes:
  - Proper initialization with useRef to persist map instance
  - Navigation controls (zoom buttons)
  - Clean cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks
  - Empty map style (basemap tiles deferred to later stages)
  - TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc documentation
  - data-testid attribute for future testing

**Design decisions:**

- Map CSS imported at component level rather than globally for better encapsulation
- Map initializes once on mount and doesn't re-initialize when props change (useEffect with empty dependency array)
- Fixed React Hook dependency array issue flagged by Code Reviewer (changed from `[initialCenter, initialZoom]` to `[]`)
- Added comment explaining empty map style is intentional for Stage 1
- Deferred optional geocoder package installation (not needed for MVP)

**Code quality:**

- All TypeScript type-check and ESLint checks pass
- Code reviewed by specialized Code Reviewer subagent
- Follows project conventions (barrel exports, component structure)
- Proper use of React hooks and cleanup patterns

### Stage 2: Create Base Map Component with Viewport State (Commit: 79d7a03)

**What was implemented:**

- Enhanced Map component with viewport state management:
  - Viewport state tracks center coordinates, zoom level, and bounds in real-time
  - React state with `useState` and `useCallback` for efficient updates
  - Event listeners for `moveend` and `zoomend` events update viewport state
  - Optional `onViewportChange` callback prop for parent components
  - Exported `ViewportState` TypeScript interface for type safety

- Reset viewport functionality:
  - Button positioned top-left with accessible styling
  - Smooth `flyTo` animation (1 second duration) returns to initial viewport
  - Stores initial viewport in `useRef` for reset
  - Proper ARIA label for accessibility

- Development debugging:
  - Debug panel in bottom-left showing current viewport (development only)
  - Uses `import.meta.env.DEV` for Vite environment detection

- MapPage component (`packages/frontend/src/pages/MapPage.tsx`):
  - Full-screen responsive layout with header, map content, footer
  - Protected route at `/map` with lazy loading
  - Displays current viewport state in footer
  - Clean semantic HTML with Tailwind CSS styling
  - Proper state initialization to match Map component defaults

- Router integration:
  - Added `/map` route with `ProtectedRoute` wrapper
  - Lazy-loaded MapPage component for code splitting
  - Exported from pages barrel export
  - Follows existing router patterns

- Comprehensive testing:
  - 23 unit tests covering all Map component functionality
  - Tests for rendering, initialization, viewport management, reset, cleanup, edge cases
  - MapLibre GL JS properly mocked for isolated testing
  - Tests verify accessibility, state updates, and lifecycle management
  - 100% test coverage for Map component

**Design decisions:**

- Used local React state rather than Zustand for viewport management:
  - Viewport state is component-specific, not global application state
  - Parent components can opt-in via `onViewportChange` callback if needed
  - Simpler and more appropriate for this use case

- `useCallback` for `updateViewport` and `resetViewport`:
  - Ensures stable function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Safe to omit from useEffect dependencies with explanatory comment

- MapPage initializes viewport state to match Map defaults:
  - Eliminates null checks and potential rendering issues
  - Footer always shows viewport info (no conditional rendering)

- Development-only debug panel:
  - Uses `import.meta.env.DEV` instead of `process.env.NODE_ENV` for Vite
  - Helpful for debugging during development without cluttering production

- Reset button placement:
  - Top-left position avoids conflict with MapLibre's navigation controls (top-right)
  - Tailwind styling matches project design system
  - Focus ring for keyboard accessibility

**Code quality:**

- All TypeScript type-check and ESLint checks pass
- Code reviewed by specialized Code Reviewer subagent with all feedback addressed:
  - Removed unused `LngLatBounds` import
  - Fixed Vite environment check (`import.meta.env.DEV`)
  - Added explanatory comment for ESLint disable
  - Simplified MapPage component (direct `setViewport` usage)
- Import order fixed per project ESLint rules
- Follows project conventions (barrel exports, component structure, lazy loading)
- Proper use of React hooks and cleanup patterns
- All 23 tests passing with comprehensive coverage

### Stage 3: GeoJSON Layer Infrastructure (Commit: 6324d6c)

**What was implemented:**

- TypeScript type system for GeoJSON features (`types.ts`):
  - EntityType union ('location-point', 'location-region', 'settlement', 'structure')
  - Feature property interfaces for each entity type with discriminated unions
  - GeoJSON Feature types (LocationPointFeature, LocationRegionFeature, SettlementFeature, StructureFeature)
  - LayerConfig and LayerVisibility interfaces for map layer management
  - Proper TypeScript strict mode compliance with exported type-only imports

- GeoJSON utility functions (`geojson-utils.ts`):
  - createLocationPointFeature() - converts location data to GeoJSON Point feature
  - createLocationRegionFeature() - converts location data to GeoJSON Polygon feature
  - createSettlementFeature() - converts settlement + location to GeoJSON Point feature
  - createStructureFeature() - converts structure + location to GeoJSON Point feature
  - filterValidFeatures() - removes null features from arrays using type guards
  - Comprehensive validation: checks for null, undefined, NaN, Infinity coordinates
  - Polygon ring validation: ensures minimum 3 coordinates per ring
  - Returns null for invalid data to enable graceful error handling

- Map layer management hook (`useMapLayers.ts`):
  - addSource/updateSource() - manage GeoJSON data sources on map
  - addLayer/removeLayer() - manage MapLibre layers with entity-specific styling
  - toggleLayerVisibility/setLayerVisible() - control layer visibility
  - addDataLayer/updateDataLayer() - convenience methods for source + layer
  - Layer style configuration constants (colors, sizes, stroke widths):
    - location-point: blue circle (6px)
    - location-region: blue fill with opacity
    - settlement: green circle (8px)
    - structure: amber circle (6px)
  - React state management with useCallback for stable function references
  - useEffect to sync visibility state changes to MapLibre map
  - Proper handling of null map instance

- Comprehensive test coverage (128 test cases):
  - geojson-utils.test.ts (84 tests):
    - Valid feature creation for all entity types
    - Edge cases: NaN, Infinity, null, undefined, zero coordinates
    - Polygon validation: empty rings, too few coordinates, holes
    - Feature filtering with type guards
    - 100% coverage of utility functions
  - useMapLayers.test.ts (44 tests):
    - Source and layer CRUD operations
    - Visibility toggling and state management
    - MapLibre GL mock with realistic map behavior
    - Async state updates with renderHook + act
    - All hook functions and edge cases covered

- Updated barrel exports (`index.ts`):
  - Exported all new types, utilities, and hooks
  - Follows existing project patterns for type-only exports

- Dependencies:
  - Added @types/geojson (2.0.0) for proper GeoJSON TypeScript types

**Design decisions:**

- Null return pattern for invalid data:
  - Allows callers to decide how to handle errors (filter, log, skip)
  - More flexible than throwing exceptions
  - Enables bulk processing with filterValidFeatures()

- Coordinate validation prevents rendering bugs:
  - Checks for NaN/Infinity prevent MapLibre crashes
  - Checks for null/undefined prevent type errors
  - Zero coordinates are valid (equator/prime meridian)

- Layer visibility managed in React state:
  - Enables UI integration (checkboxes, toggles)
  - useEffect syncs state to MapLibre map
  - Separation of concerns (React state vs. MapLibre state)

- Entity-specific styling configuration:
  - Extracted to LAYER_STYLES constant for maintainability
  - Distinct colors for each entity type (blue/green/amber)
  - Settlement circles larger (8px) than structures (6px) for hierarchy

- TypeScript discriminated unions:
  - Type-safe feature properties with EntityType discriminator
  - Enables exhaustive type checking in switch statements
  - Prevents mixing incompatible feature types

- Comprehensive validation in factories:
  - Polygon rings validated for minimum 3 coordinates
  - Prevents MapLibre errors from malformed geometry
  - Graceful degradation for missing location data

**Code quality:**

- All TypeScript type-check and ESLint checks pass (0 errors)
- 11 ESLint warnings about `any` types in tests (acceptable for MapLibre mocks)
- Code reviewed by specialized Code Reviewer subagent with approval
- TypeScript Fixer subagent resolved all type errors:
  - Removed extends GeoJsonProperties (can't extend type aliases)
  - Added GeoJSONSource type imports and assertions
  - Fixed import ordering per project ESLint rules
  - Added `as any` for MapLibre layer config (complex type unions)
- Follows project conventions:
  - Barrel exports with type-only imports
  - Vitest testing patterns with @testing-library/react
  - React hook patterns with useCallback and proper dependencies
  - JSDoc documentation for all public functions
- 128 test cases with comprehensive edge case coverage
- No security vulnerabilities detected (validated by Code Reviewer)

  - Prevents N+1 query problems when loading settlements with locations
  - Does not require user authorization (world-scoped data)
- Added `findByIds` batch method to LocationService (`packages/api/src/graphql/services/location.service.ts`)
  - Uses Prisma `$queryRaw` with `ST_AsBinary` for PostGIS geometry
  - Maintains input order (critical for DataLoader contract)
  - Returns null for missing locations (graceful degradation)
- Added location field resolver in SettlementResolver (`packages/api/src/graphql/resolvers/settlement.resolver.ts`)
  - Uses DataLoader pattern for optimal performance

- All 10 tests passing (100%)
- 214/217 total frontend tests passing (3 pre-existing failures unrelated to Stage 5)
- 1289/1290 backend tests passing (1 pre-existing flaky performance test)

**Design decisions:**

- DataLoader pattern for location loading:
  - Prevents N+1 query problems when resolving location field for multiple settlements

- Import ordering fixed per ESLint rules

### Stage 6: Structure Layer Rendering (Commit: c42f706)

**What was implemented:**

Backend:

- Added `settlement` field to Structure GraphQL type (packages/api/src/graphql/types/structure.type.ts)
  - Nullable Settlement return type with "Settlement this structure belongs to" description
- Created SettlementDataLoader (packages/api/src/graphql/dataloaders/settlement.dataloader.ts)
  - Batches settlement queries to prevent N+1 problems
  - Uses SettlementWithLocation type (Prisma payload with location relation)
- Added `findByIds` method to SettlementService (packages/api/src/graphql/services/settlement.service.ts:182-216)
  - Batch operation for DataLoader
  - Includes location relation in Prisma query
  - Returns settlements in same order as input IDs (critical for DataLoader contract)
  - No authorization (world-scoped data, auth enforced at resolver level)
- Registered SettlementDataLoader in GraphQL module and context
  - Added to providers in graphql.module.ts
  - Added settlementLoader to DataLoaders interface in graphql-context.ts
  - Exported SettlementWithLocation type from context
- Added settlement field resolver in StructureResolver (packages/api/src/graphql/resolvers/structure.resolver.ts:247-261)
  - Uses DataLoader pattern: `context.dataloaders.settlementLoader.load(structure.settlementId)`
  - Type assertion handles Prisma/GraphQL null/undefined differences
  - Comment explains GraphQL handles null->undefined conversion

Frontend:

- Created GET_STRUCTURES_FOR_MAP query (packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/structures.ts:138-163)
  - Queries structuresBySettlement with settlement and location data
  - Includes settlement.location.geojson for rendering
  - Uses settlementId parameter (structures scoped to settlement)
- Implemented useStructuresForMap hook (packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/structures.ts:316-342)
  - Follows useSettlementsForMap pattern
  - cache-and-network fetch policy for fresh data
  - Returns structures array, loading, error, refetch, networkStatus
  - Exported from hooks index (packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/index.ts)
- Created useStructureLayers hook (packages/frontend/src/components/features/map/useStructureLayers.ts)
  - Manages structure layer rendering on map
  - Fetches structures with settlement and location via useStructuresForMap
  - Validates GeoJSON type is 'Point' (prevents Polygon confusion)
  - Validates coordinates with Number.isFinite
  - Validates structure type and level fields before rendering
  - Creates structure GeoJSON features using createStructureFeature utility
  - Structures rendered at settlement's location coordinates (no direct structure location)
  - Layer ID: 'structure' (consistent with settlement/location naming)
  - Returns loading, error, structureCount
  - Exported from map index (packages/frontend/src/components/features/map/index.ts)
- Added Structure type fields (packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/structures.ts:55-57)
  - Added optional `type` and `level` fields to Structure type
  - Needed for GET_STRUCTURES_FOR_MAP query compatibility

Testing:

- 5 new tests for useStructureLayers hook (packages/frontend/src/components/features/map/useStructureLayers.test.ts)
  - Should not fetch structures when disabled
  - Should fetch structures when enabled
  - Should return loading state
  - Should return error state
  - Should return structure count
- All 5 tests passing (100%)
- Fixed 3 pre-existing test failures in useMapLayers (mock consistency issues)
- 222/222 frontend tests passing
- Backend tests unchanged (SettlementDataLoader follows LocationDataLoader pattern)

**Design decisions:**

- Structures don't have direct locations - they use Settlement's location coordinates:
  - Structures belong to settlements (not locations directly)
  - Structure markers rendered at parent settlement's location
  - Requires querying settlement with location to get coordinates
  - GET_STRUCTURES_FOR_MAP requires settlementId parameter (not kingdomId)

- DataLoader includes location relation for efficiency:
  - SettlementDataLoader fetches settlement with location in single query
  - Prevents additional N+1 when resolving settlement.location field in GraphQL
  - Uses Prisma `include: { location: true }` for optimal query performance
  - SettlementWithLocation type exported from context for type safety

- No authorization in findByIds (world-scoped data):
  - Settlements are world-scoped (accessible to all users with campaign access)
  - Follows LocationDataLoader pattern (also no authorization)
  - Authorization enforced at GraphQL resolver level where user context available
  - Documented in JSDoc comment explaining authorization strategy

- GeoJSON type validation prevents confusion:
  - Validates `geojson.type === 'Point'` before rendering
  - Prevents attempting to render Polygon or other geometry types as Point
  - Returns null for invalid geometry (filtered out by filterValidFeatures)
  - Code Reviewer feedback implemented

- Structure layer styling:
  - Amber color (#f59e0b) distinct from settlements (green) and locations (blue)
  - 6px circle size (smaller than settlements at 8px, same as location points)
  - Layer name 'structure' follows existing naming convention

**Code quality:**

- All TypeScript type-check and ESLint checks pass (0 errors)
- TypeScript Fixer subagent resolved all type errors:
  - Added type/level fields to Structure type
  - Fixed MapLibre layer types (CircleLayerSpecification, FillLayerSpecification)
  - Updated useMapLayers type definitions
  - Added structure field validations
- TypeScript Tester subagent verified all tests pass:
  - 222/222 frontend tests passing
  - Fixed 3 pre-existing useMapLayers test failures
  - 5 new useStructureLayers tests all passing
- Code Reviewer subagent approved with recommendations implemented:
  - Added authorization documentation to findByIds JSDoc
  - Added GeoJSON type validation in useStructureLayers
- Follows project conventions (barrel exports, component structure, DataLoader patterns)
- No security vulnerabilities detected

**Limitations/Future work:**

- Map component integration not completed:
  - Current design requires settlementId to query structures
  - Would need to iterate through all settlements to render all structures
  - More efficient approach: query all structures by kingdomId (requires new backend query)
- Structure layer toggles not implemented (deferred to Stage 8)
- Structure popups not implemented (deferred to Stage 7)
- No integration into Map component or MapPage yet:
  - useStructureLayers hook is ready to use
  - Requires passing settlementId props to Map component
  - Can be called for specific settlements or iterated through all settlements
