**Notes**:

- Edit pages don't exist yet, so navigation is not active
- window.alert() used as temporary UI feedback mechanism
- isNodeEditable() returns false for all types (will be updated when pages are implemented)
- Route templates use `:id` placeholder for entity IDs
- Future: Replace alert() with toast notifications when UI library is added

## Technical Decisions

### React Flow vs Other Libraries

**Decision**: Use React Flow (@xyflow/react)

**Reasoning**:

- Best React integration and TypeScript support
- Built-in minimap, controls, and interaction handlers
- Good performance with large graphs (100+ nodes)
- Active maintenance and good documentation
- Supports custom nodes and edges
- MIT license

**Alternatives considered**:

- D3.js: More flexible but requires more custom code
- Cytoscape.js: Good for scientific graphs but less React-friendly
- vis.js: Older library, less active maintenance

### Layout Algorithm

**Decision**: Use dagre for hierarchical layout

**Reasoning**:

- Proven algorithm for directed graphs
- Fast performance (100+ nodes in <100ms)
- Good integration with React Flow
- Handles cycles gracefully
- Simple API

**Alternatives considered**:

- elkjs: More sophisticated but heavier and slower
- Custom layout: Too much work for MVP

### Node Positioning Strategy

**Decision**: Auto-layout on load, manual adjustments preserved

**Reasoning**:

- Auto-layout provides good initial view
- Manual adjustments let users organize for their needs
- "Re-layout" button available to reset
- Positions stored in component state (not persisted for MVP)

**Future enhancement**: Persist layout to user preferences

### Performance Strategy

**Decision**: React.memo for nodes/edges, no virtualization initially

**Reasoning**:

- React Flow handles most performance optimization
- Memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Virtualization adds complexity
- 100 nodes should perform well without virtualization
- Can add virtualization later if needed

### Data Fetching Strategy

**Decision**: Fetch entire graph on page load, no real-time updates

**Reasoning**:

- Dependency graphs don't change frequently
- Simpler implementation for MVP
- Can add polling or subscriptions later
- "Refresh" button allows manual updates

**Future enhancement**: GraphQL subscription for real-time updates

## Integration Points

1. **Dependency Graph API** (TICKET-014):
   - `getDependencyGraph` query provides nodes and edges
   - `validateDependencyGraph` for cycle detection
   - `getNodeDependencies` and `getNodeDependents` for highlighting

2. **State Management** (TICKET-018):
   - Campaign ID from Zustand campaign store
   - Auth token for GraphQL requests

3. **Routing** (TICKET-017):
   - New `/flow` route with lazy loading
   - Protected route requiring authentication

4. **GraphQL Client** (TICKET-018):
   - Apollo Client for queries
   - Code generation for TypeScript types

---

## Success Metrics

- Flow view renders dependency graphs correctly
- All entity types visually distinct
- Can navigate graphs with 100+ nodes smoothly
- Selection and highlighting work as expected
- Auto-layout produces readable results
- No performance issues (60 FPS, <2s initial render)
- Tests pass with >80% coverage
- Accessibility standards met

---

## Notes

- This is a visualization-focused feature, not a graph editor
- Users cannot create/delete nodes or edges in the flow view (edit via forms)
- Focus on read-only visualization with good UX
- Performance is critical for usability with large campaigns
- Accessibility is important (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
