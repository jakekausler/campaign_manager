# TICKET-022: Timeline View Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a timeline view for visualizing events and encounters over world-time. The timeline will show scheduled events/encounters, allow drag-to-reschedule functionality, display availability states with color coding, and provide zoom/pan controls for time navigation.

## Technical Decisions

### Timeline Library Selection

After evaluating options (vis-timeline, react-calendar-timeline, recharts), we'll use **vis-timeline-react** because:

- Native timeline/gantt chart support with drag-and-drop
- Built-in zoom and pan controls
- Good TypeScript support
- Lightweight and performant
- Supports custom item templates and styling
- Well-maintained and documented

Alternative considered: react-calendar-timeline (more complex API, less features out-of-box)

### Data Model

From the GraphQL types analysis:

- **Events**: Have `scheduledAt` (when scheduled), `occurredAt` (when completed), `isCompleted` status
- **Encounters**: Don't have scheduling fields currently (will need backend extension)
- **World Time**: Campaign has `currentWorldTime` field for tracking "now"

### Architecture

- **Page**: `TimelinePage` at `/timeline` route (protected)
- **Components**:
  - `Timeline` - Main vis-timeline wrapper
  - `TimelineControls` - Zoom, pan, time range controls
  - `TimelineFilters` - Filter by type, location, completion status
  - `TimelineItem` - Custom item renderer for events/encounters
  - `CurrentTimeMarker` - Visual indicator for current world time
- **Hooks**:
  - `useTimelineData` - Fetch and transform events/encounters for timeline
  - `useTimelineReschedule` - Handle drag-to-reschedule mutations
- **Utils**:
  - `timeline-transforms.ts` - Transform GraphQL data to vis-timeline format
  - `timeline-validation.ts` - Validate time ranges and prevent invalid moves

## Stages

## Implementation Notes

### vis-timeline Configuration

```typescript
const options = {
  editable: {
    updateTime: true, // Allow dragging items
    remove: false, // Prevent deletion from timeline
  },
  orientation: 'top',
  stack: true, // Stack overlapping items
  zoomMin: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // Min zoom: 1 day
  zoomMax: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10, // Max zoom: 10 years
  showCurrentTime: false, // We'll render custom marker
  verticalScroll: true,
  horizontalScroll: true,
};
```

### Timeline Item Format

```typescript
interface TimelineItem {
  id: string;
  content: string; // HTML or React component
  start: Date;
  end?: Date;
  type: 'box' | 'point' | 'range';
  className?: string; // For custom styling
  style?: string; // Inline CSS
  group?: string; // For lane grouping
  editable?: boolean; // Per-item editability
  title?: string; // Tooltip text
}
```

### Color Scheme

- **Completed Events**: `bg-green-500`
- **Scheduled Events**: `bg-blue-500`
- **Overdue Events**: `bg-red-500`
- **Resolved Encounters**: `bg-green-600`
- **Unresolved Encounters**: `bg-orange-500`
- **Current Time Marker**: `border-red-600` (2px solid line)

### GraphQL Mutations Needed

For drag-to-reschedule:

- `updateEvent(id, scheduledAt)` - Already exists (verify)
- `updateEncounter(id, scheduledAt)` - Will be added in Stage 9

### URL Structure

`/timeline?filters=completed,scheduled&group=type&start=2024-01-01&end=2024-12-31`

Query params:

- `filters`: Comma-separated status filters
- `group`: Grouping strategy (type, location, none)
- `start`, `end`: Visible time range (ISO dates)

## Dependencies

- **TICKET-007**: Event/Encounter models (âœ… Complete)
- **TICKET-018**: State Management & GraphQL Client (âœ… Complete)
- **TICKET-010**: World Time System (âœ… Complete - needed for current time marker)

## Estimated Effort

**Total**: 4-5 days (12 stages Ã— 2-4 hours per stage)

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: vis-timeline may have TypeScript typing issues
   - **Mitigation**: Create custom type definitions if needed, or use alternative library

2. **Risk**: Performance with large datasets (1000+ events)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination or windowing, lazy load items in visible range

3. **Risk**: Encounter model doesn't have scheduling fields
   - **Mitigation**: Add in Stage 9 with proper migration (may require data backfill)

4. **Risk**: Complex calendar systems (custom calendars from World Time System)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with ISO dates, add calendar formatting in future ticket

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Recurring events
- Multi-select and batch reschedule
- Timeline templates (save/load views)
- Export timeline as image/PDF
- Custom calendar display integration
- Real-time collaborative editing (WebSocket sync)
