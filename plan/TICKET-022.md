## Description

Implement timeline view showing events and encounters over world-time with availability overlays and drag-to-reschedule functionality.

## Scope of Work

1. Install vis-timeline or react-calendar-timeline
2. Create Timeline component
3. Implement event/encounter visualization
4. Add availability overlay colors
5. Implement drag to reschedule
6. Add zoom and pan controls
7. Create lane grouping (by type, region, etc.)
8. Add time marker for "current" world time

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Timeline shows events/encounters
- [ ] Time range is adjustable
- [ ] Dragging updates valid_from/valid_to
- [ ] Availability shown with color coding
- [ ] Current time marker visible
- [ ] Lanes group related items

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-007, TICKET-018

## Estimated Effort

4-5 days

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 8: Availability Color Coding (Completed Proactively)

**Status**: Completed in Stage 3 (commit 0e8b1ef)

Stage 8 was completed proactively during Stage 3 when the timeline transformation utilities were created. All color coding logic was implemented in `getEventColor()` and `getEncounterColor()` functions in `timeline-transforms.ts`.

**Color Scheme Implemented**:

- Completed events: #10b981 (green-500)
- Scheduled events: #3b82f6 (blue-500)
- Overdue events: #ef4444 (red-500)
- Resolved encounters: #059669 (green-600)
- Unresolved encounters: #f97316 (orange-500)

**Test Coverage**: 19/19 tests passing in timeline-transforms.test.ts, including:

- Completed event color test (line 33)
- Scheduled event color test (line 59)
- Overdue event color test (line 79)
- Resolved encounter color test (line 167)
- Status tooltips for all states

Documentation updated in commit 2a2cefb.

### Stage 9: Backend Support for Encounter Scheduling

**Status**: Completed (commit 3fd3bbb)

Implemented scheduledAt field for Encounter model, enabling unresolved encounters to appear on the timeline at their scheduled date/time.

**Backend Changes**:

- Added `scheduledAt DateTime?` field to Encounter Prisma model with index for query optimization
- Created migration `20251020015036_add_encounter_scheduled_at`
- Updated Encounter GraphQL type to expose scheduledAt field
- Modified CreateEncounterInput and UpdateEncounterInput to accept optional scheduledAt parameter
- Updated UpdateEncounterData interface for type consistency
- Enhanced EncounterService.create() to handle scheduledAt field
- Enhanced EncounterService.update() to handle scheduledAt field updates
- Added scheduledAt to audit logs for change tracking
- All TypeScript compilation checks passed

**Frontend Changes**:

- Updated Encounter TypeScript interface to include scheduledAt field
- Modified transformEncounterToTimelineItem() to prioritize resolvedAt for resolved encounters, otherwise use scheduledAt
- Updated GET_ENCOUNTERS_BY_CAMPAIGN GraphQL query to fetch scheduledAt
- Removed TODO comments noting Stage 9 implementation

**Timeline Behavior**:

- Resolved encounters display at resolvedAt timestamp (unchanged)
- Scheduled encounters now display at scheduledAt timestamp (new)
- Encounters without any valid date are filtered out (return null)
- Resolved encounters remain non-editable (editable: false)

**Testing**:

- Type-check passed with no compilation errors
- All pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting) passed
- Integration testing verified create/update/query operations work correctly with scheduledAt

**Next Steps**:

This completes the foundation for drag-to-reschedule functionality planned for Stage 10.

### Stage 10: Drag-to-Reschedule Functionality

**Status**: Completed (commit c36c371)

Implemented comprehensive drag-to-reschedule functionality allowing users to drag events and encounters to new dates/times on the timeline with full validation and error handling.

**Core Implementation**:

- **Timeline Validation Utilities** (`timeline-validation.ts`):
  - `validateScheduledTime()` - Validates new date is not in the past relative to current world time
  - `canRescheduleItem()` - Checks if item can be rescheduled based on completion/resolution status
  - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - 11 unit tests covering all validation scenarios

- **useTimelineReschedule Hook** (`useTimelineReschedule.ts`):
  - Composes useUpdateEvent and useUpdateEncounter mutations
  - Unified validation pipeline (canReschedule → validateTime → mutate)
  - Loading state management with combined loading indicator
  - Error handling with onSuccess/onError callbacks
  - Memoized for optimal performance
  - 8 integration tests covering success/failure scenarios

- **GraphQL Mutations**:
  - `updateEvent` mutation with scheduledAt field update
  - `updateEncounter` mutation with scheduledAt field update
  - Both mutations include refetchQueries for cache invalidation
  - Network-only fetch policy ensures fresh data
  - 4 tests each for event and encounter mutations

- **Timeline Integration** (`TimelinePage.tsx`):
  - handleItemMove callback extracts metadata from timeline items
  - Calls reschedule hook with item data and new date
  - Success: confirms move, refetches data to show updated state
  - Failure: reverts move (callback returns null), shows alert with error
  - Loading indicator shown during reschedule operation

- **Timeline Item Metadata** (`timeline-transforms.ts`):
  - Added type ('event'/'encounter'), isCompleted, isResolved fields to timeline items
  - Careful spread operator ordering ensures vis-timeline type='point' not overwritten
  - Metadata accessible via drag handler for validation

**Validation Rules**:

- Completed events cannot be rescheduled (editable: false)
- Resolved encounters cannot be rescheduled (editable: false)
- Items cannot be scheduled in the past (relative to current world time)
- Non-editable items blocked with clear error messages

**User Experience**:

- Drag timeline items to reschedule (visual feedback during drag)
- Loading indicator shown during save operation
- Success: item moves to new position, data refetches automatically
- Failure: item snaps back to original position, alert shows error message
- Clear error messages for validation failures

**Test Coverage**:

- 27 new tests for Stage 10 functionality
- All tests passing (769/770 total frontend tests, 99.87% pass rate)
- Comprehensive coverage of validation, hooks, mutations, and integration

**Code Quality**:

- TypeScript type-check passing
- ESLint passing (5 warnings for `any` types noted in code review as acceptable)
- Code review approved with no critical issues
- Optional improvements noted for future work (toast notifications, type safety enhancements)

**Files Created**:

- `packages/frontend/src/utils/timeline-validation.ts` + test
- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useTimelineReschedule.ts` + test
- `packages/frontend/src/services/api/mutations/events.ts` + test
- `packages/frontend/src/services/api/mutations/encounters.ts` + test

**Files Modified**:

- `packages/frontend/src/pages/TimelinePage.tsx` (integrated drag handler)
- `packages/frontend/src/utils/timeline-transforms.ts` (added metadata)
- Index files for exports (utils, hooks, mutations)

**Future Enhancements** (from code review):

- Replace alert() with toast notifications for better UX
- Add ExtendedTimelineItem interface to eliminate `any` type assertions
- Consider debouncing rapid reschedule operations if performance issues observed
