## Implementation Notes

### Stage 8: Availability Color Coding (Completed Proactively)

**Status**: Completed in Stage 3 (commit 0e8b1ef)

Stage 8 was completed proactively during Stage 3 when the timeline transformation utilities were created. All color coding logic was implemented in `getEventColor()` and `getEncounterColor()` functions in `timeline-transforms.ts`.

**Color Scheme Implemented**:

- Completed events: #10b981 (green-500)
- Scheduled events: #3b82f6 (blue-500)
- Overdue events: #ef4444 (red-500)
- Resolved encounters: #059669 (green-600)
- Unresolved encounters: #f97316 (orange-500)

**Test Coverage**: 19/19 tests passing in timeline-transforms.test.ts, including:

- Completed event color test (line 33)
- Scheduled event color test (line 59)
- Overdue event color test (line 79)
- Resolved encounter color test (line 167)
- Status tooltips for all states

Documentation updated in commit 2a2cefb.
