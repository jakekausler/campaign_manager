## Implementation Notes

### Stage 4: Overview Tab Implementation (Commit: 2aacb46)

**Completed**: Comprehensive OverviewTab component with entity metadata display, computed fields, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

**Components Created**:

OverviewTab Component (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/OverviewTab.tsx`):

- Displays basic entity information (ID, name, timestamps) in Card-based sections
- Optional description field with conditional rendering
- Computed fields section with automatic snake_case to Title Case conversion
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality using browser Clipboard API with 2-second visual feedback
- Handles null/undefined values by displaying "N/A"
- Formats complex JSON objects with 2-space indentation for readability
- Three Card sections: Basic Information, Description (conditional), Computed Fields
- Empty state messaging when no computed fields available ("No computed fields available for this [entityType]")
- Clean, reusable `renderField()` utility for consistent field rendering
- `formatValue()` helper handles primitives, objects, dates, and null/undefined values

**Integration**:

EntityInspector Updates (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/EntityInspector.tsx`):

- Imported OverviewTab component
- Replaced placeholder Overview tab content with OverviewTab component
- Passes entity data and entityType props to OverviewTab
- Clean integration with existing Sheet and Tabs structure

**Test Coverage**:

Comprehensive test suite (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/OverviewTab.test.tsx`):

- 20 test cases with 100% pass rate
- Basic information rendering (ID, name, timestamps with locale formatting)
- Description conditional rendering (shows when available, hidden when not)
- Computed fields display with snake_case to Title Case conversion
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality with async operations and visual feedback
- Value formatting for null, undefined, boolean, numbers, and complex JSON objects
- Empty state tests for missing computed fields (both empty object and undefined)
- Accessibility tests for labels, button titles, and ARIA attributes
- Uses MSW-compatible test patterns with mock clipboard API

**Key Features**:

1. **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Browser Clipboard API with 2-second checkmark indicator, graceful error handling
2. **JSON Formatting**: Complex objects displayed with `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)` for readability
3. **Field Name Conversion**: Automatic transformation from snake_case to Title Case (e.g., "training_speed" → "Training Speed")
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces (`Entity`, `OverviewTabProps`) with exported types
5. **Error Handling**: Try-catch for clipboard failures with console.error logging
6. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS styling consistent with project design system (slate colors, rounded corners)
7. **Component Reusability**: Exported Entity interface can be reused across other inspector components

**Code Quality**:

- Import order follows ESLint rules (React imports, UI components, grouped with empty lines)
- No unused variables or imports
- All tests validate actual behavior (no no-op assertions like `expect(true).toBe(true)`)
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout (no `any` types)
- Clean function decomposition (copyToClipboard, formatValue, renderField)
- Follows single responsibility principle (each section in separate Card)

**Quality Checks**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED (0 errors)
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 errors, import order violations fixed)
- Tests: ✅ PASSED (20/20 tests passing, 921/925 total frontend tests)
- Code Review: ✅ APPROVED (all critical issues resolved)
- Pre-commit hooks: ✅ PASSED (format:check and lint passed)

**Next Steps**: Stage 5 will implement Settlement and Structure specific panels with typed variables display.

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 3: EntityInspector Core Component (Commit: b1ad688)

**Completed**: Core EntityInspector component with data fetching, loading states, error handling, and comprehensive testing.

**Components Created**:

Skeleton UI Component (`packages/frontend/src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`):

- Simple, reusable loading skeleton with pulse animation
- Follows shadcn/ui patterns and Tailwind CSS styling
- Exported from `components/ui/index.ts`

Enhanced EntityInspector (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/EntityInspector.tsx`):

- Conditional data fetching using `useSettlementDetails` and `useStructureDetails` hooks
- `skip` option prevents unnecessary GraphQL queries based on entity type
- Three distinct UI states: loading (skeleton), error (with retry), not found
- Error state displays user-friendly message with retry button
- Loading state shows skeleton placeholders for better perceived performance
- Basic entity information displayed in Overview tab (ID, name, timestamps)
- Sheet component includes built-in close button for accessibility

**Test Coverage**:

Comprehensive test suite (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/EntityInspector.test.tsx`):

- 12 test cases covering all scenarios with 100% pass rate
- Component rendering tests (open/close states)
- Settlement and Structure data loading tests
- Loading skeleton state verification
- Error handling with GraphQL failures
- Not found states for nonexistent entities
- Tab navigation and default tab selection
- Uses MSW for realistic GraphQL mocking
- Uses `renderWithApollo` helper for Apollo Client integration

**MSW Handler Improvements** (`packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/graphql-handlers.ts`):

- Distinguish between GraphQL errors (`invalid-*` IDs) and not-found cases (`nonexistent-*` IDs)
- `invalid-*` IDs return GraphQL errors for testing error state
- `nonexistent-*` IDs return null data without error for testing not-found state
- Consistent error handling across settlement and structure queries

**Demo Page Enhancements** (`packages/frontend/src/pages/EntityInspectorDemoPage.tsx`):

- Real entity IDs from mock data (settlement-1, structure-1, etc.)
- Organized sections: Settlements, Structures, Error Cases
- Clear button labels showing entity details (e.g., "Ironhold (Level 3)")
- Test buttons for error and not-found scenarios

**Code Review Fixes**:

- Removed unnecessary wrapper div around Sheet component
- Fixed test to check for content absence instead of relying on internal `data-state` attribute
- Verified Sheet component includes built-in close button (SheetContent line 62-65)

**Quality Checks**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED (0 errors)
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 errors in new code, pre-existing warnings only)
- Tests: ✅ PASSED (12/12 tests passing)
- Code Review: ✅ APPROVED (all critical issues resolved)

**Next Steps**: Stage 4 will implement the Overview tab with description and computed fields display.

### Stage 2: GraphQL Hooks for Conditions and Effects (Commit: a943d89)

**Completed**: All GraphQL hooks for fetching conditions and effects with comprehensive testing.

**New Hooks Created**:

Conditions (`packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/conditions.ts`):

- `useConditionsForEntity`: Fetches field conditions for an entity
  - Supports both instance-level and type-level conditions
  - Optional field filtering parameter
  - Cache-first fetch policy for performance
  - Returns conditions with full metadata (expression, priority, active status, version)
- `useEvaluateCondition`: Evaluates a condition with custom context
  - Lazy query pattern (doesn't execute until called)
  - Network-only fetch policy (always fresh evaluation results)
  - Returns detailed evaluation trace for debugging/explanation

Effects (`packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/effects.ts`):

- `useEffectsForEntity`: Fetches effects for a specific timing phase
  - Filters by entityType, entityId, and timing (PRE/ON_RESOLVE/POST)
  - Cache-first fetch policy
  - Returns JSON Patch operations in payload field
- `useAllEffectsForEntity`: Fetches effects from all timing phases in single query
  - Uses GraphQL field aliases for efficiency
  - Returns effects grouped by phase (preEffects, onResolveEffects, postEffects)
  - Also provides allEffects array combining all phases

**Testing**:

- 25 integration tests using MSW for GraphQL mocking
- `conditions.test.tsx`: 11 tests covering fetch, filter, evaluate, error handling, trace structure
- `effects.test.tsx`: 14 tests covering timing phases, grouping, metadata, execution history
- All tests passing with >80% coverage
- Mock data includes realistic JSONLogic expressions and JSON Patch payloads

**Mock Data & Handlers**:

- Added `mockConditions` (4 conditions) to `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/data.ts`
- Added `mockEffects` (4 effects) to `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/data.ts`
- Added GraphQL handlers for `GetConditionsForEntity`, `EvaluateFieldCondition`, `GetEffectsForEntity`, `GetAllEffectsForEntity`
- Handlers properly filter by entity type/ID and support field filtering

**Type Safety**:

- Placeholder TypeScript types defined until code generation runs
- Proper nullability for optional fields
- `EffectTiming` enum exported to prevent invalid values
- All functions fully typed with comprehensive JSDoc documentation

**Quality Checks**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED (0 errors)
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 errors, pre-existing warnings in other files only)
- Tests: ✅ PASSED (25/25 tests passing)
- Code Review: ✅ APPROVED (no critical issues)

### Stage 1: UI Component Setup (Commit: 23e8919)

**Completed**: All shadcn/ui components installed and basic EntityInspector structure created.

**Components Added**:

- `Sheet` component: Slide-out panel from right side with overlay, close button, and smooth animations
- `Tabs` component: Tabbed navigation with active state styling
- `Label` component: Form label with proper accessibility

**EntityInspector Structure**:

- Created in `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/`
- Accepts props: `entityType` ('settlement' | 'structure'), `entityId`, `isOpen`, `onClose`
- Five tab placeholders: Overview, Links, Conditions, Effects, Versions
- Sheet configured with `sm:max-w-xl` width (may need to increase to `sm:max-w-2xl` for complex data in later stages)

**Demo Infrastructure**:

- Created `EntityInspectorDemoPage` at `/inspector-demo` route
- Buttons to test both Settlement and Structure inspector types
- Allows manual testing of Sheet open/close behavior

**Dependencies Installed**:

- `@radix-ui/react-tabs@^1.1.1` - Required for Tabs component

**Quality Checks**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 errors, pre-existing warnings only)
- Code Review: ✅ APPROVED
- All components properly typed with forwardRef and displayName
- Accessibility features: ARIA labels, sr-only text, keyboard navigation
