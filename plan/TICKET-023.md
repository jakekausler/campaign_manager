## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: UI Component Setup (Commit: 23e8919)

**Completed**: All shadcn/ui components installed and basic EntityInspector structure created.

**Components Added**:

- `Sheet` component: Slide-out panel from right side with overlay, close button, and smooth animations
- `Tabs` component: Tabbed navigation with active state styling
- `Label` component: Form label with proper accessibility

**EntityInspector Structure**:

- Created in `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/`
- Accepts props: `entityType` ('settlement' | 'structure'), `entityId`, `isOpen`, `onClose`
- Five tab placeholders: Overview, Links, Conditions, Effects, Versions
- Sheet configured with `sm:max-w-xl` width (may need to increase to `sm:max-w-2xl` for complex data in later stages)

**Demo Infrastructure**:

- Created `EntityInspectorDemoPage` at `/inspector-demo` route
- Buttons to test both Settlement and Structure inspector types
- Allows manual testing of Sheet open/close behavior

**Dependencies Installed**:

- `@radix-ui/react-tabs@^1.1.1` - Required for Tabs component

**Quality Checks**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 errors, pre-existing warnings only)
- Code Review: ✅ APPROVED
- All components properly typed with forwardRef and displayName
- Accessibility features: ARIA labels, sr-only text, keyboard navigation
