## Implementation Notes

### Stage 6: Conditions Tab Implementation (Commit: 3d48d99)

**Completed**: Comprehensive Conditions tab with field condition display and interactive evaluation trace modal.

**Components Created**:

ConditionsTab Component (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/ConditionsTab.tsx`):

- Fetches conditions using `useConditionsForEntity` hook with cache-first policy
- Displays field conditions sorted by priority (highest first)
- Shows active/inactive status with color-coded badges (green for active, grey for inactive)
- Displays instance-level vs type-level badges (blue "Instance", purple "Type")
- Snake_case to Title Case conversion for field names (e.g., "is_trade_hub" → "Is Trade Hub")
- Formatted JSONLogic expression display with 2-space JSON indentation
- "Explain" button for each active condition (disabled for inactive conditions)
- Comprehensive state handling: loading, error (with retry button), empty states
- Card-based layout with consistent styling and spacing
- Proper TypeScript interfaces exported (FieldCondition type)

ConditionExplanation Component (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/ConditionExplanation.tsx`):

- Dialog modal showing detailed condition evaluation trace
- Fetches entity data (Settlement or Structure) using existing detail hooks
- Builds evaluation context from entity variables, computed fields, and base attributes
- Automatically evaluates condition on modal open using `useEvaluateCondition` hook
- Displays condition details (field, description, priority)
- Shows JSONLogic expression with formatted JSON
- Displays evaluation context (all variables passed to JSONLogic)
- Shows evaluation result with success/failure status and final value
- Step-by-step evaluation trace with operation names, inputs, outputs, and descriptions
- Proper type safety with SettlementWithVariables and StructureWithVariables interfaces
- "Done" button to close modal (avoids conflict with Dialog's X button)
- Clean Card-based sections for each aspect (details, expression, context, result, trace)

**Integration**:

EntityInspector Updates (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/EntityInspector.tsx`):

- Imported ConditionsTab component
- Replaced Conditions tab placeholder with ConditionsTab component
- Passes entityType and entityId props (converts lowercase to capitalized for GraphQL)
- Conditions tab now fully functional alongside Overview, Details, Links, Effects, and Versions tabs

index.ts Exports (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/index.ts`):

- Exported ConditionsTab component and ConditionsTabProps type
- Exported ConditionExplanation component and ConditionExplanationProps type
- Exported FieldCondition interface for reuse in other components

**Test Coverage**:

Comprehensive test suite (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/ConditionsTab.test.tsx`):

- 22 test cases with 100% pass rate (994 total frontend tests, 987 passing)
- Loading state rendering test
- Error state with error message and retry button tests
- Empty state with entity-specific messaging
- Condition list display tests (field names, descriptions, status badges, priority, JSONLogic)
- Priority sorting verification (ensures highest priority appears first)
- Instance vs type-level badge tests
- Explain button presence and enablement tests
- Modal opening and closing interaction tests
- Support for both Settlement and Structure entity types
- Accessibility tests (button labels, title attributes)
- Uses MSW for GraphQL mocking with realistic data

**Mock Data Updates**:

graphql-handlers.ts (`packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/graphql-handlers.ts`):

- Added error case handling for `entityId.startsWith('invalid-')` → GraphQL error response
- Added empty case handling for `entityId.endsWith('-empty')` → empty array response
- Maintains existing condition filtering logic (by entityType, entityId, field)

data.ts (`packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/data.ts`):

- Updated condition descriptions for better clarity and test readability
- Removed type-level condition overlap to ensure consistent test expectations
- Added back type-level condition with field "exists" for integration test compatibility

**Code Quality**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED (0 errors)
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 errors, only pre-existing warnings in other files)
- Tests: ✅ 22/22 passing (994 total frontend tests, 987 passing, 7 pre-existing failures)
- Code Review: ✅ APPROVED (all critical type safety issues resolved)
- Type Safety: Proper interfaces instead of `any` types (SettlementWithVariables, StructureWithVariables)
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all exported components and interfaces
- Consistent code patterns with existing tabs (OverviewTab, SettlementPanel, StructurePanel)

**Key Features**:

1. **JSONLogic Expression Display**: Formatted with JSON.stringify for readability, ready for syntax highlighting
2. **Interactive Evaluation**: "Explain" button triggers modal with step-by-step evaluation trace
3. **Smart Sorting**: Conditions ordered by priority (highest first) for better UX
4. **Status Indicators**: Active/inactive badges, instance/type-level badges with color coding
5. **Type Safety**: Explicit interfaces (SettlementWithVariables, StructureWithVariables) document expected data shape
6. **Error Handling**: Loading skeletons, error messages with retry, empty state messaging
7. **Accessibility**: Proper button titles, ARIA roles, disabled state explanations
8. **Context Building**: Automatically merges entity variables, computed fields, and base attributes for evaluation

**Design Decisions**:

- **Disabled Explain for Inactive**: No point evaluating inactive conditions, provides clear visual feedback
- **Automatic Evaluation**: Modal evaluates condition on open (no manual "Evaluate" button) for streamlined UX
- **Dialog Component**: Uses shadcn/ui Dialog for proper focus management and accessibility
- **Type Casting Strategy**: Used `as unknown as Interface` instead of `as any` to maintain type safety while working around missing GraphQL types
- **TODO Comments**: Added TODO comments indicating interfaces should be replaced once GraphQL Code Generator runs
- **Priority Sorting**: Higher priority conditions appear first (more important rules shown prominently)
- **Card Layout**: Consistent with other tabs for visual cohesion across EntityInspector

**Next Steps**: Stage 7 will implement the Effects tab with effect list display and execution history.

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 5: Settlement and Structure Specific Panels (Commit: bb3c5df)

**Completed**: Specialized panels for displaying Settlement and Structure entity-specific details including typed variables.

**Components Created**:

SettlementPanel Component (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/SettlementPanel.tsx`):

- Displays Settlement attributes in dedicated Card section: Kingdom ID, Campaign ID, Level, Owner ID, Is Archived
- Shows typed variables from the variables JSON field with automatic type-based formatting
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality with 2-second visual feedback for all fields
- Automatic snake_case to Title Case conversion for variable names (e.g., "has_walls" → "Has Walls")
- Proper memory leak prevention: useRef for timeout tracking, cleanup in useEffect unmount
- Empty state messaging when no typed variables available ("No typed variables available for this settlement")
- Supports all variable types: number, boolean, string, objects (with JSON.stringify formatting)
- N/A display for null/undefined values

StructurePanel Component (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/StructurePanel.tsx`):

- Displays Structure attributes in dedicated Card section: Type, Settlement ID, Level, Position X, Position Y, Orientation (with ° symbol)
- Shows typed variables from the variables JSON field with automatic type-based formatting
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality with 2-second visual feedback for all fields
- Automatic snake_case to Title Case conversion for variable names
- Proper memory leak prevention: useRef for timeout tracking, cleanup in useEffect unmount
- Empty state messaging when no typed variables available ("No typed variables available for this structure")
- Type/typeId fallback logic for backward compatibility
- Supports all variable types with consistent formatting

**EntityInspector Integration**:

- Added new "Details" tab between Overview and Links (6 tabs total)
- Updated TabsList from grid-cols-5 to grid-cols-6 to accommodate new tab
- Conditional rendering based on entityType: SettlementPanel for settlements, StructurePanel for structures
- Proper TypeScript type assertions using NonNullable<typeof query.settlement/structure>

**GraphQL Query Updates**:

GET_SETTLEMENT_DETAILS (`packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/settlements.ts`):

- Added locationId field (Settlement has locationId, not direct location access)
- Added variables field to fetch typed variables JSON data

GET_STRUCTURE_DETAILS (`packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/structures.ts`):

- Added type field (Structure display name, falls back to typeId)
- Added level field (Structure level, optional in schema)
- Added variables field to fetch typed variables JSON data

**Test Coverage**:

SettlementPanel.test.tsx (24 tests, 100% passing):

- Settlement Attributes Section (5 tests): Kingdom ID, Campaign ID, Level, Owner ID, Is Archived rendering
- Typed Variables Section (8 tests): Number/boolean display, snake_case conversion, empty states, object JSON formatting
- Copy to Clipboard (4 tests): Click functionality, checkmark visual feedback, 2-second timeout reset, error handling
- Value Formatting (3 tests): null/undefined → "N/A", boolean false → "false"
- Accessibility (2 tests): Proper labels with text-xs/font-semibold classes, title attributes on copy buttons

StructurePanel.test.tsx (24 tests, 100% passing):

- Structure Attributes Section (7 tests): Type, Settlement ID, Level, Position X/Y, Orientation with ° symbol, type/typeId fallback
- Typed Variables Section (8 tests): Number/boolean display, snake_case conversion, empty states, object JSON formatting
- Copy to Clipboard (4 tests): Click functionality, checkmark visual feedback, 2-second timeout reset, error handling
- Value Formatting (3 tests): null/undefined → "N/A", boolean true → "true"
- Accessibility (2 tests): Proper labels for all 6 fields, title attributes on copy buttons

EntityInspector.test.tsx (updated):

- Updated tab navigation test to verify all 6 tabs present (Overview, Details, Links, Conditions, Effects, Versions)

**Mock Data Updates**:

mockSettlements (`packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/data.ts`):

- Added variables field to settlement-1 with realistic typed data: prosperity (75), morale (80), has_walls (true)

mockStructures (`packages/frontend/src/__tests__/mocks/data.ts`):

- Added variables field to structure-1 with realistic typed data: garrison_size (50), is_upgraded (false), maintenance_cost (25)

**OverviewTab Improvements** (by TypeScript Tester subagent):

- Added colons to field labels for consistency: "ID:", "Name:", "Created:", "Updated:"
- Simplified timestamp labels: "Created At" → "Created", "Updated At" → "Updated"
- Updated all related tests to match new label format

**GraphQL Handler Updates**:

- Modified GetSettlementDetails and GetStructureDetails handlers to return errors for invalid entity IDs (instead of null)
- Maintains null return for nonexistent-\* IDs (for testing not-found states)

**Code Quality**:

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED (0 errors)
- ESLint: ✅ PASSED (0 new errors, pre-existing warnings only)
- Tests: ✅ 965/972 passing (99.3%) - 48 new tests added, 7 failing tests are non-critical (6 clipboard environment issues, 1 performance test marginally over threshold)
- Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup of setTimeout on component unmount
- Proper type safety with exported TypeScript interfaces (SettlementData, StructureData)
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all exported components and interfaces
- Consistent code patterns with OverviewTab for maintainability

**Key Features**:

1. **Type-Based Formatting**: Handles number, boolean, string, object, null, undefined with appropriate display
2. **JSON Object Display**: Complex objects formatted with JSON.stringify(value, null, 2) for readability
3. **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Browser Clipboard API with visual feedback, graceful error handling
4. **Snake Case Conversion**: Automatic transformation for better readability (e.g., "garrison_size" → "Garrison Size")
5. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup prevents state updates on unmounted components
6. **Empty States**: User-friendly messages when entities have no typed variables
7. **Type Fallback**: Structure uses type field if available, falls back to typeId

**Design Decisions**:

- **Read-Only Display**: Edit capability intentionally deferred to Stage 10 (Edit Mode Infrastructure) for systematic implementation across all tabs
- **Code Duplication**: Accepted for SettlementPanel and StructurePanel (renderField, formatValue, toTitleCase functions) - will refactor if a third similar panel is added
- **Tab Layout**: Used grid-cols-6 for even distribution, may need responsive adjustments in future (e.g., grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-6)
- **Field Selection**: Displayed most relevant Settlement/Structure attributes based on Prisma schema and practical utility

**Next Steps**: Stage 6 will implement the Conditions tab with field condition display and evaluation trace.

### Stage 4: Overview Tab Implementation (Commit: 2aacb46)

**Completed**: Comprehensive OverviewTab component with entity metadata display, computed fields, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

**Components Created**:

- Empty state messaging when no computed fields available ("No computed fields available for this [entityType]")
- Clean, reusable `renderField()` utility for consistent field rendering
- `formatValue()` helper handles primitives, objects, dates, and null/undefined values

**Integration**:

EntityInspector Updates (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/EntityInspector.tsx`):

- Imported OverviewTab component
- Replaced placeholder Overview tab content with OverviewTab component
- Passes entity data and entityType props to OverviewTab
- Clean integration with existing Sheet and Tabs structure

**Test Coverage**:

Comprehensive test suite (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/OverviewTab.test.tsx`):

- 20 test cases with 100% pass rate
- Basic information rendering (ID, name, timestamps with locale formatting)
- Description conditional rendering (shows when available, hidden when not)
- Computed fields display with snake_case to Title Case conversion
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality with async operations and visual feedback
- Value formatting for null, undefined, boolean, numbers, and complex JSON objects

- Uses MSW-compatible test patterns with mock clipboard API

**Key Features**:

1. **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Browser Clipboard API with 2-second checkmark indicator, graceful error handling
2. **JSON Formatting**: Complex objects displayed with `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)` for readability
3. **Field Name Conversion**: Automatic transformation from snake_case to Title Case (e.g., "training_speed" → "Training Speed")
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces (`Entity`, `OverviewTabProps`) with exported types
5. **Error Handling**: Try-catch for clipboard failures with console.error logging
6. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS styling consistent with project design system (slate colors, rounded corners)
7. **Component Reusability**: Exported Entity interface can be reused across other inspector components

**Code Quality**:

- Import order follows ESLint rules (React imports, UI components, grouped with empty lines)
- No unused variables or imports
- All tests validate actual behavior (no no-op assertions like `expect(true).toBe(true)`)
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout (no `any` types)
- Clean function decomposition (copyToClipboard, formatValue, renderField)
- Follows single responsibility principle (each section in separate Card)

**Quality Checks**:

- Three distinct UI states: loading (skeleton), error (with retry), not found
- Error state displays user-friendly message with retry button
- Loading state shows skeleton placeholders for better perceived performance
- Basic entity information displayed in Overview tab (ID, name, timestamps)
- Sheet component includes built-in close button for accessibility

**Test Coverage**:

Comprehensive test suite (`packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/EntityInspector.test.tsx`):

  - Supports both instance-level and type-level conditions
  - Optional field filtering parameter
  - Cache-first fetch policy for performance
  - Returns conditions with full metadata (expression, priority, active status, version)
- `useEvaluateCondition`: Evaluates a condition with custom context
  - Lazy query pattern (doesn't execute until called)
  - Network-only fetch policy (always fresh evaluation results)
  - Returns detailed evaluation trace for debugging/explanation

Effects (`packages/frontend/src/services/api/hooks/effects.ts`):

- `useEffectsForEntity`: Fetches effects for a specific timing phase
  - Filters by entityType, entityId, and timing (PRE/ON_RESOLVE/POST)
  - Cache-first fetch policy
  - Returns JSON Patch operations in payload field
- `useAllEffectsForEntity`: Fetches effects from all timing phases in single query
