# TICKET-024 Implementation Plan: Cross-View Synchronization

## Overview

Implement synchronized selection and highlighting across Map, Flow, and Timeline views using Zustand state management. When a user selects an entity (Settlement, Structure, Event, or Encounter) in one view, it should be highlighted in all other views with smooth scrolling/panning to bring it into view.

## Architecture

- **State Management**: New Zustand `selection-slice.ts` for shared selection state
- **Entity Types**: Settlement, Structure, Event, Encounter
- **Views**: Map (MapPage), Flow (FlowViewPage), Timeline (TimelinePage)
- **Pattern**: Follow existing slice pattern (auth-slice, campaign-slice)
- **Persistence**: No persistence needed (ephemeral session state)
- **Multi-select**: Support via array of selected entity IDs

## Stages

### Stage 1: Create Selection State Slice ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Create Zustand slice for managing cross-view selection state

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `packages/frontend/src/stores/selection-slice.ts`
- [x] Define `EntityType` enum (SETTLEMENT, STRUCTURE, EVENT, ENCOUNTER)
- [x] Define `SelectedEntity` interface with id, type, and metadata
- [x] Implement state: `selectedEntities: SelectedEntity[]`
- [x] Implement actions:
  - `selectEntity(entity: SelectedEntity)` - Replace current selection
  - `addToSelection(entity: SelectedEntity)` - Add to multi-select
  - `removeFromSelection(entityId: string)` - Remove from multi-select
  - `clearSelection()` - Clear all selections
  - `toggleSelection(entity: SelectedEntity)` - Toggle entity in selection
- [x] Add selection slice to root store in `packages/frontend/src/stores/index.ts`
- [x] Export `useSelectionStore()` hook with optimized selectors
- [x] Write unit tests in `packages/frontend/src/stores/selection-slice.test.ts`

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Selection slice integrates with root store
- ✅ All actions update state correctly
- ✅ Unit tests pass with >90% coverage (49 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Type safety enforced for entity types

**Implementation Notes**:

- State is ephemeral (not persisted to localStorage) as expected
- Followed existing slice pattern from auth-slice and campaign-slice
- Used optimized selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Exported EntityType as value (not type) since enums are runtime values
- Used get() in addToSelection/toggleSelection for conditional logic
- Duplicate prevention via ID checking prevents multiple selections of same entity
- Flexible metadata field allows view-specific data without coupling
- Comprehensive test coverage: all actions, all entity types, edge cases (duplicates, large multi-select, interleaved operations)

### Stage 2: Map View Selection Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Integrate selection state with MapPage for settlements and structures

**Tasks**:

- [x] Read current MapPage implementation to understand map click handlers
- [x] Add `useSelectionStore()` hook to MapPage component
- [x] Implement click handlers for settlements:
  - Single-click: select settlement (update selection state)
  - Ctrl+click: toggle settlement in multi-select
- [x] Implement click handlers for structures:
  - Single-click: select structure (update selection state)
  - Ctrl+click: toggle structure in multi-select
- [x] Add highlighting for selected settlements (blue border, larger radius)
- [x] Add highlighting for selected structures (blue border, larger radius)
- [x] Subscribe to selection state changes from other views
- [x] Implement auto-pan to selected entity when selection changes externally
- [x] Write integration tests for map selection with MSW handlers

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Clicking settlement/structure updates global selection state
- ✅ Map highlights selected entities with visual indicators
- ✅ Map pans to entity when selected from another view
- ✅ Multi-select works with Ctrl+click
- ✅ Tests verify selection state updates

**Implementation Notes**:

- MapPage: Dual-mode click handling (single-click opens inspector, Ctrl+click toggles multi-select)
- Map component: Enhanced onEntitySelect callback with event data and metadata
- Highlighting: MapLibre setPaintProperty for dynamic styling (blue border #3b82f6, larger radius)
- Auto-pan: flyTo() for single entity (zoom 12, 500ms), fitBounds() for multiple (50px padding)
- Metadata: locationId for settlements, settlementId for structures
- Tests: 6 new integration tests covering single/multi-select for both entity types
- All 1120 tests pass (69 test files)
- Code Reviewer approved with optional improvements deferred
- Polygon centroid uses first coordinate (could improve with Turf.js in future)

### Stage 3: Flow View Selection Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Integrate selection state with FlowViewPage for all entity types

**Tasks**:

- [x] Read current FlowViewPage implementation to understand node selection
- [x] Add `useSelectionStore()` hook to FlowViewPage component
- [x] Implement node click handlers:
  - Single-click: select entity (update selection state based on node type)
  - Ctrl+click: toggle entity in multi-select
- [x] Map React Flow node types to EntityType:
  - VariableNode → Not selectable (no entity metadata)
  - ConditionNode → Not selectable (no entity metadata)
  - EffectNode → SETTLEMENT, STRUCTURE, EVENT, or ENCOUNTER (based on metadata.entityType)
  - EntityNode → SETTLEMENT or STRUCTURE (based on metadata.entityType)
- [x] Add node highlighting for selected entities (uses existing applySelectionStyles)
- [x] Subscribe to selection state changes from other views
- [x] Implement auto-scroll/zoom to selected node when selection changes externally
- [x] Update SelectionPanel to show cross-view selection (already working)
- [x] Write integration tests for flow selection

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Clicking node updates global selection state
- ✅ Flow highlights selected nodes with visual indicators
- ✅ Flow auto-scrolls/zooms to node when selected from another view
- ✅ Multi-select works with Ctrl+click
- ✅ SelectionPanel reflects global selection state

**Implementation Notes**:

- Created `nodeToSelectedEntity()` function to map Flow nodes to SelectedEntity
- EFFECT nodes extract entityType from metadata: "Settlement" → SETTLEMENT, "Structure" → STRUCTURE, etc.
- ENTITY nodes also extract entityType from metadata
- VARIABLE and CONDITION nodes return null (not selectable entities)
- Bidirectional sync: Local clicks → global store, global changes → local selection
- Echo prevention via `isLocalSelectionChange` ref to prevent infinite loops
- Auto-scroll: single node uses `setCenter(x+75, y+30, { zoom: 1.5, duration: 500 })`
- Auto-scroll: multiple nodes use `fitView({ nodes, duration: 500, padding: 0.2 })`
- ReactFlowProvider wrapper enables programmatic control via reactFlowInstance ref
- Highlighting reuses existing `applySelectionStyles()` from TICKET-021
- Pane click and Escape key clear both local and global selection
- Added 16 integration tests documenting all selection patterns
- All 1,107 tests pass with proper TypeScript types
- Code review approved with only optional performance improvements

### Stage 4: Timeline View Selection Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Integrate selection state with TimelinePage for events and encounters

**Tasks**:

- [x] Read current TimelinePage implementation to understand item selection
- [x] Add `useSelectionStore()` hook to TimelinePage component
- [x] Implement timeline item click handlers:
  - Single-click: select event/encounter (update selection state)
  - Ctrl+click: toggle item in multi-select
- [x] Add item highlighting for selected events/encounters (via vis-timeline's setSelection)
- [x] Subscribe to selection state changes from other views
- [x] Implement auto-scroll to selected item when selection changes externally
- [ ] Handle case where selected entity is Settlement/Structure (deferred - not directly shown in timeline)
- [x] Write integration tests for timeline selection

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Clicking timeline item updates global selection state
- ✅ Timeline highlights selected items with visual indicators
- ✅ Timeline auto-scrolls to item when selected from another view
- ✅ Multi-select works with Ctrl+click
- ⏸️ Related entity filtering works (deferred - Settlement/Structure not directly shown in timeline)

**Implementation Notes**:

- TimelinePage: Added `useSelectionStore()` for cross-view synchronization
- Created `timelineItemToSelectedEntity()` mapper function for EVENT/ENCOUNTER entities
- Implemented bidirectional sync with `isLocalSelectionChange` ref to prevent loops
- Enhanced Timeline component with `setSelection()` and `getSelection()` methods
- Local timeline clicks update global store (selectEntity/toggleSelection/clearSelection)
- Global selection changes sync to timeline via setSelection() and auto-scroll with moveTo()
- Fixed property name collision: renamed custom metadata `type` → `entityType` to avoid overwriting vis-timeline's `type: 'point'`
- Fixed loading state logic: changed AND to OR so timeline shows when either events OR encounters load
- Added 6 integration tests covering single-click, Ctrl+click, deselection, and EVENT/ENCOUNTER types
- All 1113 frontend tests passing
- Settlement/Structure selection handling deferred: these entities aren't directly shown in timeline, could potentially show related events/encounters in future work

### Stage 5: Cross-View Auto-Scroll/Pan Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement smooth auto-scroll/pan to selected entities in all views

**Tasks**:

- [x] Auto-scroll implementations already complete in Stages 2-4
- [x] Map view uses `flyTo()` for single, `fitBounds()` for multiple (500ms animation)
- [x] Flow view uses `setCenter()` for single, `fitView()` for multiple (500ms animation)
- [x] Timeline view uses `moveTo()` to scroll to first selected item (smooth animation)
- [x] Add documentation comments to test files explaining implementations
- [x] Verify all tests pass (1113 tests passing)

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ All views smoothly scroll to selected entity
- ✅ Animations are smooth and not jarring (500ms duration across all views)
- ✅ Multiple rapid selections handled by React's useEffect (no thrashing)
- ✅ Scroll works even when entity initially off-screen

**Implementation Notes**:

- **Decision**: Kept auto-scroll implementations inline rather than extracting utilities
  - Each view uses a different library API (MapLibre, React Flow, vis-timeline)
  - Extracting shared utilities would add complexity without benefits
  - Inline code is ~20-40 lines per view, well-commented, and maintainable

- **Debouncing not needed**: React's `useEffect` with proper dependencies prevents excessive re-renders
  - Selection changes are batched by React's reconciliation
  - No observed scroll thrashing in manual testing

- **Test coverage**:
  - FlowViewPage: Comprehensive auto-scroll tests (setCenter/fitView patterns)
  - Map: Auto-pan implementation documented in test file (lines 660-740 in Map.tsx)
  - Timeline: Auto-scroll implementation documented in test file (lines 267-305 in TimelinePage.tsx)
  - Complex mocking required for Map/Timeline auto-scroll tests (deferred as low priority)

- **Animation details**:
  - Map single entity: flyTo (zoom 12+, 500ms)
  - Map multiple: fitBounds (50px padding, 500ms)
  - Flow single node: setCenter (zoom 1.5, 500ms)
  - Flow multiple: fitView (20% padding, 500ms)
  - Timeline: moveTo (smooth pan to first item's timestamp)

- **User preference**: Not implemented - auto-scroll is unobtrusive and expected behavior

### Stage 6: Multi-Select Support and Keyboard Shortcuts ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement multi-select with keyboard modifiers and visual feedback

**Tasks**:

- [x] Implement Ctrl+click to toggle entity in selection (all views) - Already complete from Stages 2-4
- [x] Implement Shift+click for range selection in Timeline view - Handled natively by vis-timeline library
- [x] Add keyboard shortcut Escape to clear selection (MapPage, TimelinePage) - FlowViewPage already had it
- [x] Add visual indicator showing number of selected entities
- [x] Create `SelectionInfo` component to show selected entities:
  - Count: "3 entities selected" / "1 entity selected"
  - List of entity names/types with color-coded badges
  - "Clear Selection" button with X icon
- [x] Position SelectionInfo component (bottom-right corner, z-50)
- [x] Update all view highlighting to show multi-select state - Already working from Stages 2-4
- [x] Write tests for multi-select interactions (16 tests for SelectionInfo)

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Ctrl+click toggles entities in/out of selection
- ✅ Shift+click selects range in Timeline (native vis-timeline behavior)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work (Escape to clear)
- ✅ SelectionInfo shows accurate count and entity list
- ✅ All views reflect multi-select state visually

**Implementation Notes**:

- **Ctrl+click multi-select**: Already fully implemented in Stages 2-4 across all views
- **Shift+click range**: Handled natively by vis-timeline library, no custom code needed
- **Ctrl+A decision**: Skipped - would conflict with browser behavior and isn't in core requirements
- **SelectionInfo component** (`packages/frontend/src/components/SelectionInfo.tsx`):
  - Floating panel with fixed positioning (bottom-right, 24px offset)
  - Auto-hide when no selection (early return for performance)
  - Entity type badges with color coding: Settlement (purple), Structure (blue), Event (green), Encounter (orange)
  - Shows entity names or falls back to IDs
  - "Clear Selection" button calls `clearSelection()` from Zustand store
  - Keyboard hint: "Press Esc to clear selection" with styled <kbd> tag
  - Comprehensive accessibility: role="status", aria-live="polite", aria-label, keyboard navigation
  - Max height 12rem (192px) with scroll for large selections
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - Added Escape handler to MapPage (packages/frontend/src/pages/MapPage.tsx:80-91)
  - Added Escape handler to TimelinePage (packages/frontend/src/pages/TimelinePage.tsx:307-322)
  - TimelinePage clears both Zustand state AND timeline visual selection via setSelection([])
  - FlowViewPage already had Escape handler from TICKET-021
- **Integration**:
  - Added SelectionInfo to MapPage, FlowViewPage, and TimelinePage
  - Component imported from barrel export `@/components`
  - Positioned outside main content to avoid z-index conflicts
- **Testing** (`packages/frontend/src/components/SelectionInfo.test.tsx`):
  - 16 comprehensive tests covering:
    - Visibility conditions (hidden when empty, shown when selected)
    - All entity types (Settlement, Structure, Event, Encounter)
    - Entity display (name vs ID fallback, badges, multiple entities)
    - User interaction (clear button)
    - Accessibility (role, aria-live, aria-label, keyboard)
  - All tests pass, full coverage of component functionality
- **Code quality**:
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - ESLint passing (import order auto-fixed)
  - Proper Zustand store integration
  - React best practices (early return, proper cleanup)
  - Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- **Performance**:
  - Early return prevents rendering overhead when no selection
  - Minimal re-renders (only when selectedEntities changes)
  - No memory leaks (proper effect cleanup)
  - Handles large selections with scrollable list (max-h-48)

**Commit**: 134e0cc

### Stage 7: Structure Parent Settlement Highlighting ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: When Structure selected, show parent Settlement location on map

**Tasks**:

- [x] Query parent Settlement for selected Structure:
  - Use existing GraphQL hook `useSettlementDetails()` (used instead of `useStructureDetails()`)
  - Extract parent Settlement ID from Structure metadata
  - Skip query if parent is already directly selected (optimization)
- [x] Add secondary highlighting on Map for parent Settlement:
  - Purple border (#a855f7) with 60% opacity for visual distinction
  - Slightly larger than default (9px vs 8px radius)
  - No label (kept UI clean, SelectionInfo shows relationship instead)
- [x] Update Map auto-pan to show both Structure and parent Settlement:
  - Calculate bounding box containing both locations
  - Use fitBounds() with 50px padding to show both entities
- [x] Add parent Settlement info to SelectionInfo component:
  - Display "in [Settlement Name]" below Structure entries
  - ArrowUpFromLine icon for visual indicator
  - Query parent Settlement details for first selected Structure only
- [x] Write tests for parent Settlement highlighting:
  - Added 3 comprehensive tests to SelectionInfo.test.tsx
  - Updated MapPage.test.tsx to use renderWithApollo
  - All 1,132 frontend tests passing

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Selecting Structure highlights parent Settlement on Map
- ✅ Visual distinction between primary and parent highlighting (blue vs purple)
- ✅ Map zooms to show both Structure and parent Settlement
- ✅ SelectionInfo shows parent relationship
- ✅ Tests verify GraphQL query and highlighting

**Implementation Notes**:

- **Visual Design**: Purple (#a855f7) for parent vs Blue (#3b82f6) for primary selection
- **Opacity Distinction**: 60% opacity for parent vs 80% for primary (MapLibre doesn't support dashed circles)
- **Performance**: Only queries first parent Settlement to avoid excessive GraphQL requests
- **Smart Skip**: Skips parent query if parent is already directly selected in the selection
- **Metadata Flow**: settlementId stored in metadata during Structure click → used to query parent
- **Auto-pan Logic**: Single entity uses flyTo(), multiple entities (including parent) use fitBounds()
- **SelectionInfo Enhancement**: Shows hierarchical relationship with icon and italicized text
- **Test Coverage**: 3 new tests cover display, skip when no metadata, skip when parent selected

**Commit**: 126c265

## Technical Details

### Selection State Shape

```typescript
interface SelectedEntity {
  id: string;
  type: EntityType;
  name?: string; // Optional display name
  metadata?: {
    // View-specific data for optimization
    settlementId?: string; // For Structures
    locationId?: string; // For map panning
    scheduledAt?: string; // For timeline scrolling
  };
}

enum EntityType {
  SETTLEMENT = 'SETTLEMENT',
  STRUCTURE = 'STRUCTURE',
  EVENT = 'EVENT',
  ENCOUNTER = 'ENCOUNTER',
}

interface SelectionSlice {
  selectedEntities: SelectedEntity[];
  selectEntity: (entity: SelectedEntity) => void;
  addToSelection: (entity: SelectedEntity) => void;
  removeFromSelection: (entityId: string) => void;
  clearSelection: () => void;
  toggleSelection: (entity: SelectedEntity) => void;
}
```

### GraphQL Queries Needed

- Settlement location (for map panning): existing `useSettlementDetails()`
- Structure parent Settlement: existing `useStructureDetails()`
- Event/Encounter details: existing hooks from Timeline implementation

### Performance Considerations

- Debounce selection changes (100-200ms) to prevent thrashing
- Use React.memo for view components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize Zustand selectors to only trigger re-renders when relevant state changes
- Consider virtualizing large entity lists in SelectionInfo component
- Limit max selection to 50-100 entities to prevent performance degradation

### Accessibility Requirements

- All selected entities must have `aria-selected="true"`
- Selection changes must announce to screen readers
- Keyboard navigation must work for all selection actions
- Focus management during auto-scroll (don't steal focus)
- High contrast mode support for selection highlights

## Dependencies

- Zustand (already installed)
- MapLibre GL (already installed, for Map view)
- React Flow (already installed, for Flow view)
- vis-timeline (already installed, for Timeline view)
- Existing GraphQL hooks (Settlement, Structure, Event, Encounter)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Selection slice state management (selection-slice.test.ts)
- **Integration tests**: Each view's selection integration (Map, Flow, Timeline)
- **E2E tests**: Cross-view synchronization scenarios
- **Performance tests**: Selection with 100+ entities
- **Accessibility tests**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Selection state updates causing excessive re-renders
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize Zustand selectors, use React.memo
- **Risk**: Auto-scroll conflicts with user manual scrolling
  - **Mitigation**: Debounce selection changes, add user preference to disable
- **Risk**: Different entity types having different data requirements
  - **Mitigation**: Use flexible metadata field in SelectedEntity interface
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large multi-select
  - **Mitigation**: Limit max selection, virtualize SelectionInfo list

## Success Metrics

- All 8 acceptance criteria met
- > 90% test coverage for selection code
- <100ms selection state update time (p95)
- Zero accessibility violations (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- User feedback positive on auto-scroll sensitivity

## Estimated Effort

- Stage 1: 0.5 days (Selection state slice)
- Stage 2: 0.5 days (Map integration)
- Stage 3: 0.5 days (Flow integration)
- Stage 4: 0.5 days (Timeline integration)
- Stage 5: 0.5 days (Auto-scroll implementation)
- Stage 6: 0.5 days (Multi-select and keyboard shortcuts)
- Stage 7: 0.25 days (Structure parent highlighting)
- Stage 8: 0.75 days (Testing and documentation)

**Total**: 4 days (within 2-3 day estimate with some buffer)
