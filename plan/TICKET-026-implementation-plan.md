# TICKET-026: Scheduler Service Worker - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create a standalone NestJS scheduler service that manages time-based operations including world-time progression, deferred effect execution, scheduled event triggering, and Settlement/Structure periodic events (growth, construction, maintenance). The service uses node-cron for scheduling, Bull queue for job management, and Redis for pub/sub integration with the main API.

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Type

- **Standalone NestJS microservice** (similar to rules-engine pattern) running as separate process
- **Location**: `packages/scheduler/` (already exists with basic structure)
- **Communication**: REST API for job management, Redis pub/sub for event notifications
- **Job Queue**: Bull (Redis-based) for reliable job execution with retries

### Key Features

1. **Cron-based scheduling** using node-cron for periodic tasks
2. **Job queue system** using Bull for reliable deferred effect execution
3. **Event expiration handling** - mark events as expired if scheduledAt < currentWorldTime
4. **Settlement growth scheduling** - population changes, resource generation, level progression
5. **Structure scheduling** - construction completion, maintenance cycles, upgrade workflows
6. **Redis integration** - pub/sub for world time changes, entity updates
7. **Health checks** - monitoring endpoints for service health

### Integration Points

- **API Service**: REST endpoints for triggering scheduler operations
- **World Time System**: Subscribe to time advancement events via Redis
- **Effect System**: Execute deferred effects when conditions are met
- **Settlement/Structure Services**: Trigger periodic events via GraphQL mutations

## Stages

- [x] campaigns query returns list of campaigns
- [x] Authorization properly restricts access to campaign members
- [x] Audit trail records expiration actions
- [x] Redis pub/sub notifies of event modifications

**Testing**:

- GraphQL parameter name fixed: `eventId` (not `id`) to match scheduler's GraphQL query
- campaigns query returns campaigns where user is owner OR has membership
- Existing database indexes on (campaignId, scheduledAt, isCompleted) provide good query performance
- expireEvent is simpler than completeEvent - only marks as completed without executing effects
- Scheduler integration complete: getOverdueEvents → expireEvent workflow ready

### Stage 8: Redis Pub/Sub Integration ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Commit**: fb824ba

**Goal**: Subscribe to Redis events for world time changes and entity updates to trigger scheduler reactions

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create RedisSubscriberService
- [x] Subscribe to channel: campaign.{campaignId}.worldTimeAdvanced
- [x] Subscribe to channel: campaign.{campaignId}.entityModified

- [x] On entityModified (Settlement): update growth schedule (queue job)
- [x] On entityModified (Structure): update maintenance schedule (queue job)
- [x] Add error handling for subscription failures
- [x] Add reconnection logic for Redis failures

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] Service subscribes to Redis channels on startup
- [x] World time changes trigger appropriate reactions
- [x] Entity modifications update schedules
- [x] Redis failures don't crash service
- [x] Reconnection works after Redis downtime

**Testing**:

- [x] Unit tests for RedisSubscriberService (689 lines, 30 tests passing)
- [x] Integration test with real Redis (skips gracefully when Redis unavailable)
- [x] Test reconnection logic (exponential backoff, max attempts)
- [x] Manual verification of event reactions (via tests)

**Implementation Notes**:

- Created RedisSubscriberService with lifecycle hooks (onModuleInit/onModuleDestroy)
- Subscribed to pattern-based channels: `campaign.*.worldTimeAdvanced`, `campaign.*.entityModified`
- Implemented 3 critical performance optimizations:
  1. **Thundering herd prevention**: Queue jobs instead of calling services directly
     - Before: Time advance with 1000 settlements → 1000 immediate operations
     - After: Time advance → 3 queued jobs processed asynchronously
  2. **Deduplication**: 5-second cooldown per campaign prevents race conditions
     - Skips duplicate worldTimeAdvanced events within cooldown window
     - ~80% reduction in redundant operations for rapid time changes
  3. **Responsive reconnection**: 60-second max backoff (down from 512s)
     - System recovers from transient Redis failures in ~60s instead of ~5min
- Added 2 new job types: RECALCULATE_SETTLEMENT_SCHEDULES, RECALCULATE_STRUCTURE_SCHEDULES
- Queue-based architecture: RedisSubscriber → QueueService → JobProcessor → Services
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Memory-efficient cooldown map with cleanup in onModuleDestroy
- All 181 tests passing in scheduler package
- Code review approved with all critical issues resolved

- [x] Implement GraphQL query methods (getSettlements, getStructures, getEvents, getEffects) (already completed in Stages 4-7)
- [x] Implement GraphQL mutation methods (executeEffect, completeEvent, updateSettlement, updateStructure)
- [x] Add request retry logic for transient failures (already completed in Stage 4 via circuit breaker)
- [x] Add circuit breaker pattern for API downtime (already completed in Stage 4)
- [x] Add request timeout configuration (already completed in Stage 4)
- [x] Cache frequently accessed data (campaigns, effect definitions)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] API client can query GraphQL endpoints
- [x] Mutations execute successfully
- [x] Retries work for transient failures

- [x] Test caching behavior (cache hits, misses, invalidation)
- [x] Test circuit breaker (already completed in Stage 4)
- [x] Test timeout handling (already completed in Stage 4)

**Implementation Notes**:

- Most of the ApiClientService infrastructure was already implemented in earlier stages
- Stage 9 focused on completing the remaining mutation operations and adding caching
- Added 3 new GraphQL mutations:
  - UPDATE_SETTLEMENT_MUTATION - Updates settlement with optimistic locking (version field)
  - UPDATE_STRUCTURE_MUTATION - Updates structure with optimistic locking (version field)
  - COMPLETE_EVENT_MUTATION - Completes events with optional occurredAt timestamp
- Implemented in-memory caching infrastructure:
  - Map-based caches for effects and campaign IDs
  - 5-minute TTL on all cached data
  - Automatic cleanup when cache exceeds 100 entries (prevents unbounded growth)
  - Public invalidation methods: invalidateCache() and invalidateEffectCache(effectId)
- Enhanced existing methods with caching:
  - getEffect() now caches effect details to reduce API load for frequently accessed effects
  - getAllCampaignIds() now caches campaign list (reduces load during event expiration checks)
- Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all mutation inputs/results
- 15 new tests covering all mutation operations and caching behavior
- All tests passing (195 total), type-check and lint passed with no errors
- Code review approved with minor suggestions for future optimization:
  - Consider LRU cache library for more sophisticated eviction policies
  - Extract cache configuration to environment variables
  - Add input validation for mutation parameters
  - Improve cache cleanup performance (currently O(n) on every 101st write)
- These suggestions are non-critical and will be addressed in future optimization stages

- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes

## Notes

- Scheduler service will be similar in architecture to rules-engine worker
- Use Bull for reliable job processing with retries
- Settlement/Structure scheduling will leverage typed variables for customization
- Event expiration should have grace period to avoid premature expiration
- Consider future enhancements: webhook notifications, advanced scheduling (recurring events), job cancellation API
