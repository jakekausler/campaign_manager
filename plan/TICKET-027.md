- **Commits**:

## Description
Implement branching system that allows creating alternate timeline branches and viewing campaign state in different branches.

## Scope of Work
1. Create Branch CRUD operations
2. Implement fork operation (create child branch)
3. Add branch switching in UI
4. Implement version resolution for branches
5. Create branch comparison view
6. Add branch metadata (name, description, fork point)
7. Implement branch hierarchy visualization
8. Version resolution for Settlement entities
9. Version resolution for Structure entities
10. Fork operation copies Settlement hierarchy and Structure relationships

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can create branch from current state
- [ ] Branch inherits parent versions
- [ ] Can switch between branches in UI
- [ ] Branch changes don't affect parent
- [ ] Can view branch comparison
- [ ] Branch hierarchy is clear
- [ ] Settlement versions resolve correctly across branches
- [ ] Structure versions resolve correctly across branches
- [ ] Forking preserves Settlement-Structure hierarchy

## Dependencies
- Requires: TICKET-007

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days
