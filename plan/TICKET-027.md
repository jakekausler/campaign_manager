# TICKET-027: Branching System (Fork & View)

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - Planning: 5fda299 (Implementation plan created)

## Implementation Notes

- **2025-10-29**: Created comprehensive 10-stage implementation plan in `TICKET-027-implementation-plan.md`
  - Stages 1-4: Backend (Branch service, fork operation, GraphQL API, version resolution)
  - Stages 5-8: Frontend (Branch selector, fork UI, hierarchy visualization, comparison view)
  - Stages 9-10: Integration testing, documentation, and production polish
  - Leverages existing versioning system from TICKET-007
  - Database schema already in place (Branch model exists), no migrations needed

- **2025-10-29**: âœ… Completed Stage 1 (Branch Service & Basic CRUD Operations) - Commit: aaf526e
  - Created BranchService with full CRUD operations (create, findById, findByCampaign, update, delete, find)
  - Implemented hierarchy methods: getHierarchy() for tree structure, getAncestry() for parent chain walking
  - Added comprehensive validation: campaign access checks, parent validation, delete protection for branches with children
  - Extracted checkCampaignAccess() helper method for reusable authorization logic
  - Created Branch input DTOs (CreateBranchInput, UpdateBranchInput, BranchWhereInput)
  - Added getBranchById() method to VersionService for branch resolution
  - Wrote 27 comprehensive unit tests covering all operations, hierarchy, validation, and edge cases
  - All tests passing, code reviewed and security-hardened (added access check to create() per reviewer feedback)

## Description

Implement branching system that allows creating alternate timeline branches and viewing campaign state in different branches.

## Scope of Work

1. Create Branch CRUD operations
2. Implement fork operation (create child branch)
3. Add branch switching in UI
4. Implement version resolution for branches
5. Create branch comparison view
6. Add branch metadata (name, description, fork point)
7. Implement branch hierarchy visualization
8. Version resolution for Settlement entities
9. Version resolution for Structure entities
10. Fork operation copies Settlement hierarchy and Structure relationships

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can create branch from current state
- [ ] Branch inherits parent versions
- [ ] Can switch between branches in UI
- [ ] Branch changes don't affect parent
- [ ] Can view branch comparison
- [ ] Branch hierarchy is clear
- [ ] Settlement versions resolve correctly across branches
- [ ] Structure versions resolve correctly across branches
- [ ] Forking preserves Settlement-Structure hierarchy

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-007

## Estimated Effort

4-5 days
