# TICKET-028 Implementation Plan: Branch Merge & Conflict Resolution

## Overview

Implement comprehensive branch merging capabilities with 3-way merge algorithm, conflict detection, resolution UI, and merge preview. This builds on the existing branching system from TICKET-027.

## Stage 1: 3-Way Merge Algorithm Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement core 3-way merge algorithm for version comparison and merging

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `MergeService` class in `packages/api/src/graphql/services/merge.service.ts`
- [x] Implement `findCommonAncestor(sourceBranchId, targetBranchId)` to identify merge base
- [x] Implement `getEntityVersionsForMerge(entityType, entityId, sourceBranch, targetBranch, baseBranch, worldTime)` to retrieve the three versions
- [x] Create `MergeResult` type with fields: `success`, `conflicts`, `mergedPayload`, `conflictDetails`
- [x] Implement `compareVersions(base, source, target)` to detect changes in each branch
- [x] Create unit tests for common ancestor finding (linear hierarchy, sibling branches, complex trees)
- [x] Create unit tests for version retrieval logic

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Can find common ancestor branch for any two branches
- [x] Can retrieve base, source, and target versions for 3-way merge
- [x] All unit tests passing

**Completion Notes** (commit 17147d0):

- MergeService uses dependency injection following NestJS patterns
- findCommonAncestor uses O(n+m) algorithm with Set for O(1) lookups
- getEntityVersionsForMerge fetches versions in parallel for performance
- Complete TypeScript type definitions with JSDoc documentation
- 9 comprehensive unit tests with full coverage of edge cases
- Code Reviewer approved with no critical issues

## Stage 2: Conflict Detection Logic ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement conflict detection for entity property changes

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `ConflictDetector` class for conflict analysis
- [x] Implement `detectPropertyConflicts(basePayload, sourcePayload, targetPayload)` for JSON property comparison
- [x] Create `ConflictType` enum: `BOTH_MODIFIED`, `BOTH_DELETED`, `MODIFIED_DELETED`, `DELETED_MODIFIED`
- [x] Create `Conflict` interface with `path`, `type`, `baseValue`, `sourceValue`, `targetValue`
- [x] Implement JSON path-based conflict representation (e.g., `settlement.population`, `structure.defenseRating`)
- [x] Handle nested property conflicts (e.g., changes within Settlement's `resources` object)
- [x] Implement auto-resolution for non-conflicting changes (only one branch modified)
- [x] Create unit tests for all conflict scenarios (property modified in both, deleted in one, etc.)

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Detects conflicts when both branches modify same property
- [x] Auto-resolves when only one branch has changes
- [x] Provides detailed conflict information with JSON paths
- [x] All unit tests passing for conflict detection

**Completion Notes** (commit ffcbc4b):

- ConflictDetector class implements sophisticated 3-way merge conflict detection
- Recursive path traversal collects all nested property paths (e.g., "resources.gold", "config.settings.display.theme")
- Deep equality checking handles objects, arrays, primitives with proper comparison logic
- Auto-resolution logic: source only → source value, target only → target value, both identical → shared value, neither → base value
- All conflict types implemented: BOTH_MODIFIED, MODIFIED_DELETED, DELETED_MODIFIED, BOTH_DELETED (auto-resolves)
- Entity-level scenarios handled: creation in both branches (all properties conflict), deletion vs modification (major conflict), both deleted (auto-resolve)
- MergeService.compareVersions() updated to use ConflictDetector with human-readable descriptions and suggestions
- 29 comprehensive ConflictDetector unit tests + 9 MergeService tests = 38 total tests passing
- Code Reviewer approved with optional enhancement suggestions for future (depth limits, additional docs, type guards)

## Stage 3: Settlement & Structure Conflict Detection ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement entity-specific conflict detection for Settlement and Structure entities

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `SettlementMergeHandler` class extending base merge logic
- [x] Implement Settlement-specific conflict detection (population, resources, leaderName, etc.)
- [x] Handle Settlement association conflicts (parentSettlement changes, kingdom changes)
- [x] Create `StructureMergeHandler` class extending base merge logic
- [x] Implement Structure-specific conflict detection (defenseRating, capacity, status, etc.)
- [x] Handle Structure association conflicts (settlement changes, location changes)
- [x] Create unit tests for Settlement merge scenarios (15+ scenarios)
- [x] Create unit tests for Structure merge scenarios (15+ scenarios)

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Settlement property conflicts detected correctly
- [x] Structure property conflicts detected correctly
- [x] Association changes handled properly
- [x] All entity-specific tests passing

**Completion Notes** (commit eba8236):

- SettlementMergeHandler and StructureMergeHandler use composition pattern (delegate to ConflictDetector)
- Generic ConflictDetector already handles ALL property conflicts including associations (kingdomId, settlementId, etc.)
- Entity handlers enhance generic detection with domain-specific descriptions and suggestions
- Settlement: 17 comprehensive tests (name, kingdom, location, level, nested variables, arrays, creation, deletion)
- Structure: 19 comprehensive tests (name, type, settlement, level, nested variables, status, complex scenarios)
- All 36 tests passing, code reviewed and approved
- Architecture follows Open/Closed Principle: base detector closed for modification, entity handlers extend via composition

  - PASS 2: Create versions atomically after validation passes
- Created MergeHistory model in Prisma schema with full audit trail
- Added database migration 20251030000427_add_merge_history
- Implemented helper methods: findDivergenceTime, discoverEntitiesForMerge, applyConflictResolutions, setValueAtPath, findUnresolvedConflicts

**Completion Notes** (commit c2e9f22 - backend complete, frontend pending):

**Backend Service Layer:**

- Implemented `MergeService.cherryPickVersion()` method with full validation and conflict detection
- Uses 2-way conflict detection (source vs target) with empty base for proper cherry-pick semantics
- Returns conflict information for manual resolution when conflicts detected
- Auto-applies version when no conflicts exist
- Creates audit trail with 'CHERRY_PICK' operation type
- Added `CherryPickResult` interface and `CherryPickVersionInput` GraphQL input type
- Created 11 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios (all passing)

**GraphQL API Layer:**

- Added `cherryPickVersion` mutation to MergeResolver with full authorization
- Created `CherryPickResult` GraphQL type with success/conflict fields
- Validates source version and target branch existence
- Enforces same-campaign constraint (prevents cross-campaign cherry-pick)
- Requires GM/OWNER authorization via checkCanMerge() method
- Converts service MergeConflict to GraphQL types with JSON serialization
- Returns conflict information for UI, auto-applies when no conflicts
- Delegates business logic to MergeService layer
- Created 7 comprehensive integration tests:
  1. Validation: non-existent source version (NotFoundException)
  2. Validation: non-existent target branch (NotFoundException)
  3. Validation: cross-campaign cherry-pick (BadRequestException)
  4. Authorization: user without campaign access (ForbiddenException)
  5. Success: cherry-pick without conflicts (auto-apply)
  6. Success: conflict detection when target modified
  7. Success: conflict resolution with manual resolutions
- All 21 integration tests passing (7 new + 14 existing merge/preview)
- Fixed bugs discovered during testing:
  - Prisma model name: entityVersion → version
  - Conflict mapping: resolver generates descriptions/suggestions
  - Cherry-pick semantics: compares against current target state
  - Test cleanup: proper foreign key handling
- Code Reviewer approved with zero critical issues

**Remaining:** Frontend hooks (useCherryPickVersion), UI components (Cherry-Pick button, CherryPickDialog), UI tests

## Stage 9: Merge History Tracking & Visualization

- [ ] Test edge cases: merging into ancestor, circular merge attempts, concurrent merges
- [ ] Performance test: Merge with 100+ entity conflicts
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling polish to all UI components
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for conflict resolution (n/p for next/previous, s/t for source/target)
- [ ] Update documentation: Add merge system to `docs/features/branching-system.md`
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md and README.md with merge feature references

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] Performance acceptable with large conflict sets
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Production-ready polish applied

## Notes

- **3-Way Merge**: Uses common ancestor (merge base) + source branch + target branch to detect conflicts
- **Auto-Resolution**: If only one branch modified a property, automatically use that value
- **Conflict**: Both branches modified the same property - requires manual resolution
- **Cherry-Pick**: Selectively apply specific version from one branch to another
- **Merge Direction**: Typically merge child branch → parent branch, but algorithm supports any direction
- **World Time**: Merge happens at a specific world time point - uses version resolution to get entity states
- **Transaction Safety**: All merge operations must be atomic (rollback on failure)
- **Authorization**: Only GM and OWNER roles can execute merges (same as branch creation/deletion)

## Dependencies

- TICKET-027 (Branching System - Fork & View) - ✅ COMPLETE
- Existing versioning system from TICKET-007
- Existing Settlement and Structure entities

## Estimated Effort

4-5 days (consistent with ticket estimate)
