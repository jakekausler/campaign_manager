# TICKET-028 Implementation Plan: Branch Merge & Conflict Resolution

## Overview

Implement comprehensive branch merging capabilities with 3-way merge algorithm, conflict detection, resolution UI, and merge preview. This builds on the existing branching system from TICKET-027.

## Stage 1: 3-Way Merge Algorithm Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement core 3-way merge algorithm for version comparison and merging

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `MergeService` class in `packages/api/src/graphql/services/merge.service.ts`
- [x] Implement `findCommonAncestor(sourceBranchId, targetBranchId)` to identify merge base
- [x] Implement `getEntityVersionsForMerge(entityType, entityId, sourceBranch, targetBranch, baseBranch, worldTime)` to retrieve the three versions
- [x] Create `MergeResult` type with fields: `success`, `conflicts`, `mergedPayload`, `conflictDetails`
- [x] Implement `compareVersions(base, source, target)` to detect changes in each branch
- [x] Create unit tests for common ancestor finding (linear hierarchy, sibling branches, complex trees)
- [x] Create unit tests for version retrieval logic

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Can find common ancestor branch for any two branches
- [x] Can retrieve base, source, and target versions for 3-way merge
- [x] All unit tests passing

**Completion Notes** (commit 17147d0):

- MergeService uses dependency injection following NestJS patterns
- findCommonAncestor uses O(n+m) algorithm with Set for O(1) lookups
- getEntityVersionsForMerge fetches versions in parallel for performance
- Complete TypeScript type definitions with JSDoc documentation
- 9 comprehensive unit tests with full coverage of edge cases
- Code Reviewer approved with no critical issues

## Stage 2: Conflict Detection Logic ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement conflict detection for entity property changes

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `ConflictDetector` class for conflict analysis
- [x] Implement `detectPropertyConflicts(basePayload, sourcePayload, targetPayload)` for JSON property comparison
- [x] Create `ConflictType` enum: `BOTH_MODIFIED`, `BOTH_DELETED`, `MODIFIED_DELETED`, `DELETED_MODIFIED`
- [x] Create `Conflict` interface with `path`, `type`, `baseValue`, `sourceValue`, `targetValue`
- [x] Implement JSON path-based conflict representation (e.g., `settlement.population`, `structure.defenseRating`)
- [x] Handle nested property conflicts (e.g., changes within Settlement's `resources` object)
- [x] Implement auto-resolution for non-conflicting changes (only one branch modified)
- [x] Create unit tests for all conflict scenarios (property modified in both, deleted in one, etc.)

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Detects conflicts when both branches modify same property
- [x] Auto-resolves when only one branch has changes
- [x] Provides detailed conflict information with JSON paths
- [x] All unit tests passing for conflict detection

**Completion Notes** (commit ffcbc4b):

- ConflictDetector class implements sophisticated 3-way merge conflict detection
- Recursive path traversal collects all nested property paths (e.g., "resources.gold", "config.settings.display.theme")
- Deep equality checking handles objects, arrays, primitives with proper comparison logic
- Auto-resolution logic: source only → source value, target only → target value, both identical → shared value, neither → base value
- All conflict types implemented: BOTH_MODIFIED, MODIFIED_DELETED, DELETED_MODIFIED, BOTH_DELETED (auto-resolves)
- Entity-level scenarios handled: creation in both branches (all properties conflict), deletion vs modification (major conflict), both deleted (auto-resolve)
- MergeService.compareVersions() updated to use ConflictDetector with human-readable descriptions and suggestions
- 29 comprehensive ConflictDetector unit tests + 9 MergeService tests = 38 total tests passing
- Code Reviewer approved with optional enhancement suggestions for future (depth limits, additional docs, type guards)

## Stage 3: Settlement & Structure Conflict Detection ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Implement entity-specific conflict detection for Settlement and Structure entities

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `SettlementMergeHandler` class extending base merge logic
- [x] Implement Settlement-specific conflict detection (population, resources, leaderName, etc.)
- [x] Handle Settlement association conflicts (parentSettlement changes, kingdom changes)
- [x] Create `StructureMergeHandler` class extending base merge logic
- [x] Implement Structure-specific conflict detection (defenseRating, capacity, status, etc.)
- [x] Handle Structure association conflicts (settlement changes, location changes)
- [x] Create unit tests for Settlement merge scenarios (15+ scenarios)
- [x] Create unit tests for Structure merge scenarios (15+ scenarios)

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Settlement property conflicts detected correctly
- [x] Structure property conflicts detected correctly
- [x] Association changes handled properly
- [x] All entity-specific tests passing

**Completion Notes** (commit eba8236):

- SettlementMergeHandler and StructureMergeHandler use composition pattern (delegate to ConflictDetector)
- Generic ConflictDetector already handles ALL property conflicts including associations (kingdomId, settlementId, etc.)
- Entity handlers enhance generic detection with domain-specific descriptions and suggestions
- Settlement: 17 comprehensive tests (name, kingdom, location, level, nested variables, arrays, creation, deletion)
- Structure: 19 comprehensive tests (name, type, settlement, level, nested variables, status, complex scenarios)
- All 36 tests passing, code reviewed and approved
- Architecture follows Open/Closed Principle: base detector closed for modification, entity handlers extend via composition

  - Validation: Verify all conflicts have resolutions BEFORE any DB writes
  - PASS 2: Create versions atomically after validation passes
- Created MergeHistory model in Prisma schema with full audit trail
- Added database migration 20251030000427_add_merge_history

- [x] Create E2E test: Settlement merge with property and association conflicts
- [x] Create E2E test: Structure merge with property and association conflicts
- [x] Create E2E test: Cherry-pick workflow across multiple branches
- [x] Create E2E test: Multi-level branch merging (grandchild → child → parent)
- [x] Create E2E test: Merge history tracking and retrieval
- [x] Test error handling: unauthorized merge attempts, invalid conflict resolutions
- [x] Test edge cases: merging into ancestor, circular merge attempts, concurrent merges
- [x] Performance test: Merge with 100+ entity conflicts
- [x] Add loading states and error handling polish to all UI components
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for conflict resolution (n/p for next/previous, s/t for source/target)
- [ ] Update documentation: Add merge system to `docs/features/branching-system.md`
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md and README.md with merge feature references

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] All E2E tests passing
- [x] Error handling comprehensive and user-friendly
- [x] Performance acceptable with large conflict sets
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [x] Production-ready polish applied

**Completion Notes** (commit 618e1b9):

- Created comprehensive E2E test suite with 13 test scenarios (all passing)
- Test coverage: complete workflow, Settlement/Structure merges, cherry-pick, multi-level, history, errors, edge cases, performance
- Fixed critical bugs: executeMerge() error propagation, common ancestor validation
- Performance validated: 100+ entities with conflicts merged in ~1.3 seconds
- Test infrastructure: detectEntityConflicts() helper, comprehensive test data patterns
- Loading states and error handling already implemented in Stages 6-9 (MergePreviewDialog, ConflictResolutionDialog, CherryPickDialog, MergeHistoryView)
- Keyboard shortcuts and documentation updates deferred (optional enhancements)

## Notes

- **3-Way Merge**: Uses common ancestor (merge base) + source branch + target branch to detect conflicts
- **Auto-Resolution**: If only one branch modified a property, automatically use that value
- **Conflict**: Both branches modified the same property - requires manual resolution
- **Cherry-Pick**: Selectively apply specific version from one branch to another
- **Merge Direction**: Typically merge child branch → parent branch, but algorithm supports any direction
- **World Time**: Merge happens at a specific world time point - uses version resolution to get entity states
- **Transaction Safety**: All merge operations must be atomic (rollback on failure)
- **Authorization**: Only GM and OWNER roles can execute merges (same as branch creation/deletion)

## Dependencies

- TICKET-027 (Branching System - Fork & View) - ✅ COMPLETE
- Existing versioning system from TICKET-007
- Existing Settlement and Structure entities

## Estimated Effort

4-5 days (consistent with ticket estimate)
