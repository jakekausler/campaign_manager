## Implementation Notes

- **2025-10-29**: Created comprehensive 10-stage implementation plan in `TICKET-028-implementation-plan.md`
- **2025-10-29**: Completed Stage 1 - 3-Way Merge Algorithm Foundation (commit 17147d0)
  - Implemented `MergeService` class with dependency injection (BranchService, VersionService)
  - Implemented `findCommonAncestor()` method - O(n+m) time complexity using Set for fast lookups
  - Implemented `getEntityVersionsForMerge()` method - Fetches base/source/target versions in parallel
  - Created comprehensive TypeScript types: MergeResult, MergeConflict, ConflictType, ConflictDetail, ThreeWayVersions
  - Placeholder `compareVersions()` method for Stage 2
  - 9 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios (linear hierarchy, siblings, complex trees, missing versions)
  - All tests passing, code reviewed and approved
- **2025-10-29**: Completed Stage 2 - Conflict Detection Logic (commit ffcbc4b)
  - Created `ConflictDetector` class with sophisticated conflict analysis algorithm
  - Implements recursive path traversal for nested property detection with JSON path notation (e.g., "resources.gold")
  - Deep equality checking for objects and arrays to detect meaningful changes
  - Smart auto-resolution: only source changed → use source, only target changed → use target, both identical → use shared value
  - Handles all conflict types: BOTH_MODIFIED, MODIFIED_DELETED, DELETED_MODIFIED, BOTH_DELETED
  - Entity-level scenarios: creation in both branches, deletion in one branch, deletion in both
  - Updated `MergeService.compareVersions()` to use ConflictDetector instead of placeholder
  - Added human-readable conflict descriptions and suggestions for UI display
  - 29 comprehensive unit tests for ConflictDetector covering all scenarios
  - All 38 tests passing (29 ConflictDetector + 9 MergeService), code reviewed and approved
  - Architecture overview:
    - Stages 1-5: Backend (3-way merge algorithm ✅, conflict detection ✅, GraphQL API, merge execution, history tracking)
    - Stages 6-7: Frontend (merge preview UI, conflict resolution UI)
    - Stages 8-9: Advanced features (cherry-pick, merge history visualization)
    - Stage 10: Integration testing, performance testing, and production polish
  - Leverages existing branching system from TICKET-027 (fork & view functionality)
  - Leverages existing versioning system from TICKET-007 (version resolution algorithm)
  - Uses 3-way merge algorithm (common ancestor + source + target) for automatic conflict detection
  - Auto-resolves non-conflicting changes, requires manual resolution only when both branches modified same property
- **2025-10-29**: Completed Stage 3 - Settlement & Structure Conflict Detection (commit eba8236)
  - Created `SettlementMergeHandler` class extending base ConflictDetector via composition
  - Created `StructureMergeHandler` class extending base ConflictDetector via composition
  - Both handlers delegate core 3-way merge algorithm to ConflictDetector (follows Open/Closed Principle)
  - Settlement handler detects conflicts in all properties: name, level, kingdomId, locationId, and nested variables
  - Structure handler detects conflicts in all properties: name, type, level, settlementId, and nested variables
  - Domain-specific conflict descriptions: human-readable messages for kingdom changes, location changes, type changes, etc.
  - Domain-specific resolution suggestions: guidance for population conflicts, resource conflicts, defense rating conflicts, status conflicts
  - Handles association changes (kingdomId → kingdom change, settlementId → settlement change) as property conflicts
  - Comprehensive test coverage: 17 tests for Settlement (name, kingdom, location, level, nested variables, arrays, creation, deletion)
  - Comprehensive test coverage: 19 tests for Structure (name, type, settlement, level, nested variables, status, complex scenarios)
  - All 36 tests passing (17 Settlement + 19 Structure), code reviewed and approved
  - Architecture: Generic ConflictDetector handles ALL property detection, entity handlers add semantic meaning
  - Ready for GraphQL API integration in Stage 4
- **2025-10-29**: Completed Stage 4 - Merge Service GraphQL API (commit 4740a4a)
  - Created `MergeResolver` with GraphQL queries and mutations for merge operations
  - Implemented `previewMerge` query: Shows conflicts and auto-resolved changes before execution
  - Implemented `executeMerge` mutation: Placeholder for Stage 5 (validates input, enforces authorization)
  - Authorization: previewMerge requires campaign access, executeMerge requires GM/OWNER role
  - Validates branches exist, same campaign, and have common ancestor before proceeding
  - Created comprehensive GraphQL types: MergePreview, EntityMergePreview, MergeConflict, AutoResolvedChange, MergeResult
  - Created input types with validation: PreviewMergeInput, ExecuteMergeInput, ConflictResolution
  - Added `@ValidateNested` decorators for proper nested validation of conflict resolutions
  - Enhanced VersionService with `getVersionsForBranchAndType()` method for entity discovery
  - Registered MergeResolver in GraphQL module
  - 13+ integration test scenarios covering validation, authorization, preview, and conflicts
  - Tests verify error handling (NotFoundException, BadRequestException, ForbiddenException)
  - Tests validate conflict detection for simple and nested properties
  - Code reviewed and approved (fixed duplicate JSDoc comments, added nested validation)
  - Ready for merge execution implementation in Stage 5
- **2025-10-30**: Completed Stage 5 - Merge Execution & Version Creation (commit d81a5c2)
  - Implemented complete merge execution system with two-pass approach for efficiency and correctness
  - PASS 1: Analyze all entities, detect conflicts, collect merge data (no database writes)
  - Validation: Verify ALL conflicts have resolutions BEFORE any database writes (prevents wasted work)
  - PASS 2: Create versions atomically after validation passes (all-or-nothing behavior)
  - Created MergeHistory model in Prisma schema for comprehensive audit trail
  - Added database migration 20251030000427_add_merge_history with proper indexes and relations
  - Implemented helper methods: findDivergenceTime, discoverEntitiesForMerge, applyConflictResolutions, setValueAtPath, findUnresolvedConflicts
  - Added MERGE operation type to AuditService for audit logging
  - Updated MergeResolver.executeMerge() to call MergeService.executeMerge()
  - Fixed critical bug: base version uses divergence time (when branches split) not worldTime for accurate 3-way merge
  - Removed silent fallback in findDivergenceTime(): now throws explicit BadRequestException instead of new Date(0)
  - Transaction wrapping ensures atomic behavior (rollback on any error)
  - All 59 merge-related tests passing (9 MergeService unit + 50 integration/handler tests)
  - Code Reviewer approved with all three critical issues addressed
  - Ready for frontend merge preview UI in Stage 6
- **2025-10-30**: Completed Stage 6 - Frontend Merge Preview UI (commit 5d6637a)

  - Uses 2-way conflict detection (source vs target) with empty base `{}` for proper cherry-pick semantics
  - Returns conflict information when conflicts detected (allows UI to preview before requiring resolution)
  - Auto-applies version when no conflicts exist (seamless operation)
  - Manual conflict resolution via optional `resolutions` parameter

  - Converts service `MergeConflict` to GraphQL types with JSON serialization
  - Returns conflict information for UI to display before requiring resolution
  - Auto-applies when no conflicts exist, returns conflicts when detected
  - Delegates business logic to MergeService.cherryPickVersion() layer
  - Created 7 comprehensive integration tests covering:
    - Validation: non-existent source version, non-existent target branch, cross-campaign cherry-pick
    - Authorization: user without campaign access (ForbiddenException)
    - Success scenarios: no conflicts, conflict detection, conflict resolution
  - All 21 integration tests passing (7 new cherry-pick + 14 existing merge/preview)
