# TICKET-028: Branch Merge & Conflict Resolution

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - Planning: 3362521 (Implementation plan created)

## Implementation Notes

- **2025-10-29**: Created comprehensive 10-stage implementation plan in `TICKET-028-implementation-plan.md`
  - Stages 1-5: Backend (3-way merge algorithm, conflict detection, GraphQL API, merge execution, history tracking)
  - Stages 6-7: Frontend (merge preview UI, conflict resolution UI)
  - Stages 8-9: Advanced features (cherry-pick, merge history visualization)
  - Stage 10: Integration testing, performance testing, and production polish
  - Leverages existing branching system from TICKET-027 (fork & view functionality)
  - Leverages existing versioning system from TICKET-007 (version resolution algorithm)
  - Uses 3-way merge algorithm (common ancestor + source + target) for automatic conflict detection
  - Auto-resolves non-conflicting changes, requires manual resolution only when both branches modified same property

## Description

Implement branch merging with 3-way merge, conflict detection, and conflict resolution UI.

## Scope of Work

1. Create merge algorithm (3-way merge)
2. Implement conflict detection
3. Create conflict resolution UI
4. Add merge preview
5. Implement cherry-pick functionality
6. Create merge history tracking
7. 3-way merge handling for Settlement data
8. 3-way merge handling for Structure data
9. Detect conflicts in Settlement properties and associations
10. Detect conflicts in Structure properties and associations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can merge branch into parent
- [ ] Conflicts are detected correctly
- [ ] UI shows conflicts clearly
- [ ] Can resolve conflicts manually
- [ ] Merge preview shows changes
- [ ] Can cherry-pick specific versions
- [ ] Settlement merge conflicts are detected
- [ ] Structure merge conflicts are detected
- [ ] Merge preview shows Settlement/Structure changes

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-027

## Estimated Effort

4-5 days
