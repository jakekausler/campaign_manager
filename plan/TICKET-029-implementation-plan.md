# TICKET-029 Implementation Plan: Real-time Updates via WebSocket/Redis

## Overview

This ticket implements real-time updates using Socket.IO and Redis pub/sub to push state changes and invalidations to connected clients. The implementation spans both backend (API service) and frontend (React client).

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend Client → Socket.IO Client → API Gateway (WebSocket)
                                          ↓
                                     Socket.IO Gateway
                                          ↓
                                    Redis Pub/Sub Adapter
                                          ↓
                     ┌───────────────────┴───────────────────┐
                     ↓                                       ↓
            Rules Engine Worker                    Scheduler Worker
            (publishes events)                     (publishes events)
```

**Tasks**:

- [x] Define subscription room naming conventions
  - Campaign rooms: `campaign:{campaignId}`
  - Settlement rooms: `settlement:{settlementId}`
  - Structure rooms: `structure:{structureId}`
  - Created `packages/api/src/websocket/types.ts` with:

  - Located `packages/api/src/auth/services/auth.service.ts` (JwtService available)
  - Located `packages/api/src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts` (JWT validation pattern)
  - Located `packages/api/src/auth/interfaces/jwt-payload.interface.ts` (JwtPayload structure)
  - Identified that Socket.IO tokens should be extracted from `handshake.auth.token` or `handshake.query.token`
- [x] Research existing authorization infrastructure
  - Located `packages/api/src/auth/services/campaign-membership.service.ts`
    - Has `canView(campaignId, userId)` method for read access checks
    - Has `getUserRole(campaignId, userId)` for role-based checks
  - Located `packages/api/src/auth/services/permissions.service.ts`
    - Has `Permission` enum with granular permissions
    - Has role-to-permission mappings (OWNER, GM, PLAYER, VIEWER)
  - Confirmed Socket.IO handles automatic room cleanup on disconnect
- [x] Implement connection authentication
  - Extract user/session info from WebSocket handshake
  - Validate JWT token from connection auth/query params
  - Reject unauthenticated connections
  - Store authenticated user data in socket.data
  - Implemented in `handleConnection()` method with full JWT validation
- [x] Update WebSocket module dependencies
  - Import AuthModule to get JwtService
  - Import CampaignMembershipService for authorization
  - Update WebSocketModule providers and imports
  - Added constructor injection for JwtService and CampaignMembershipService
- [x] Create subscription handler methods
  - `@SubscribeMessage('subscribe_campaign')` → `handleSubscribeToCampaign(campaignId)`
  - `@SubscribeMessage('subscribe_settlement')` → `handleSubscribeToSettlement(settlementId)`
  - `@SubscribeMessage('subscribe_structure')` → `handleSubscribeToStructure(structureId)`
  - `@SubscribeMessage('unsubscribe_campaign')` → `handleUnsubscribeFromCampaign(campaignId)`
  - `@SubscribeMessage('unsubscribe_settlement')` → `handleUnsubscribeFromSettlement(settlementId)`
  - `@SubscribeMessage('unsubscribe_structure')` → `handleUnsubscribeFromStructure(structureId)`
  - All 6 handlers implemented with proper error handling and logging
- [x] Add authorization checks for subscriptions
  - Verify user has access to requested campaign using `canView()`
  - Verify user has access to settlement (via campaign ownership)
  - Verify user has access to structure (via campaign ownership)
  - Return error events for unauthorized attempts
  - Campaign subscriptions fully implemented with `canView()` check
  - Settlement/structure subscriptions have basic implementation (parent campaign lookup deferred to Stage 3)
- [x] Handle automatic cleanup on disconnect
  - Socket.IO automatically removes clients from rooms on disconnect
  - Log disconnection events for debugging
  - Verified in `handleDisconnect()` method with appropriate logging
- [x] **TESTS COMPLETED** - Write tests for subscription logic
  - Test successful subscription to valid rooms
  - Test authorization failures (no campaign access)
  - Test invalid JWT token rejection
  - Test missing JWT token rejection
  - Test automatic cleanup on disconnect
  - Test multiple simultaneous subscriptions
  - **All 31 tests passing**, including security improvements from code review

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Clients can subscribe to campaign-specific rooms
- [x] Clients can subscribe to settlement-specific rooms
- [x] Clients can subscribe to structure-specific rooms
- [x] Unauthorized subscription attempts are rejected
- [x] Room cleanup happens automatically on disconnect
- [x] Tests pass (31/31 passing)

**Notes**:

- Reuse existing AuthService/PermissionService for authorization
- Consider rate limiting for subscription requests
- Log subscription events for debugging

**Implementation Details Discovered**:

1. **JWT Validation Pattern**:
   - Extract token from `socket.handshake.auth.token` or `socket.handshake.query.token`
   - Use `JwtService.verify(token)` to validate and decode
   - On success, store user info in `socket.data` as `AuthenticatedSocketData`
   - On failure, disconnect socket with error message

2. **Authorization Pattern**:
   - Inject `CampaignMembershipService` into `WebSocketGatewayClass`
   - For campaign subscriptions: `await campaignMembershipService.canView(campaignId, userId)`
   - For settlement/structure: Need to look up parent campaign ID first, then check campaign access
   - Return `{ error: 'Unauthorized' }` event response for failed authorization

3. **Module Dependencies**:
   - `WebSocketModule` needs to import `AuthModule` (for JwtService)
   - `WebSocketModule` needs to import relevant services (CampaignMembershipService, etc.)
   - May need to import `JwtModule` separately if not exported by AuthModule

4. **Room Subscription Pattern**:
   - Use `socket.join(getRoomName(RoomType.CAMPAIGN, campaignId))` for subscriptions
   - Use `socket.leave(getRoomName(RoomType.CAMPAIGN, campaignId))` for unsubscriptions
   - Return success/error response to client after subscription attempt

5. **Testing Pattern**:
   - Mock `JwtService.verify()` to return valid/invalid payloads
   - Mock `CampaignMembershipService.canView()` to simulate authorization scenarios
   - Mock `socket.join()` and `socket.leave()` to verify room operations
   - Test both `handshake.auth.token` and `handshake.query.token` paths

**Files to Modify**:

- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.module.ts` (add imports/providers)
- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.gateway.ts` (add auth + subscription handlers)
- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.gateway.test.ts` (add new test suites)
- `packages/api/src/websocket/types.ts` (may need additional interfaces)

**Notes**:

- Ensure hooks handle rapid mount/unmount cycles (React StrictMode)
- Debounce subscription requests if necessary
- Consider adding optimistic UI updates before event confirmation

---

### Stage 6: Integration & Cache Invalidation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (Commit: c5459b7)

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create cache invalidation handlers
  - Handle `state_invalidated` events
  - Refetch affected queries from Apollo cache
  - Clear specific cache entries
- [x] Create entity update handlers

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Cache invalidations trigger proper refetches
- [x] Entity updates appear in UI without manual refresh
- [x] Multiple clients stay in sync
- [x] World time updates propagate correctly
- [x] Settlement and structure updates are reflected immediately
- [x] Tests pass (16/16 tests passing)

**Notes**:

- Used Apollo's `cache.evict()` and `cache.gc()` pattern for cache invalidation
- Centralized cache sync in single hook mounted at app level
- Debug logging controlled by `env.features.debug`

**Implementation Summary**:

Created `useWebSocketCacheSync` hook that:

- Subscribes to campaign WebSocket events via `useCampaignSubscription`
- Routes events to specialized handlers based on event type
- Updates Apollo cache and Zustand state automatically
- Mounted once at app level in App.tsx for global cache synchronization

Event handling strategies:

- **entity_updated**: Evicts specific entity from cache by typename + ID
- **state_invalidated**: Evicts computed fields based on scope (campaign-wide or entity-specific)
- **world_time_changed**: Updates Zustand store + evicts time-dependent queries
- **settlement_updated/structure_updated**: Evicts entity + parent queries, handles delete/create/update operations

---

### Stage 7: Error Handling & Resilience

**Goal**: Add comprehensive error handling and resilience features

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Tasks**:

- [x] Add error logging for WebSocket events
  - Log connection errors with `console.error()`
  - Log subscription errors in hooks
  - Log event handling errors in cache sync
  - Structured error messages with context
- [x] Implement connection health checks
  - Socket.IO built-in ping/pong monitoring (25s interval, 5s timeout)
  - Added explicit ping/pong event handlers for debugging
  - Automatic reconnection on health check failure
- [x] Add circuit breaker for subscriptions
  - Prevent infinite re-subscription loops
  - Implemented exponential backoff with max retries (10 attempts = ~17 minutes)
  - Circuit breaker triggers permanent error state after max attempts
- [x] Create user-facing error messages
  - ConnectionIndicator shows connection status
  - Shows reconnection attempt counter
  - Shows "(Max retries reached)" when circuit breaker triggers
  - Auto-hides when stable (3s after connection)
- [x] Document edge cases
  - Multiple tabs: Each tab maintains independent WebSocket connection
  - Network switches: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Server restarts: Clients auto-reconnect when server comes back online
  - Token refresh: Automatic reconnection with new token
  - Circuit breaker: Stops after 10 failed attempts, user must refresh page
- [x] Write tests for error scenarios
  - Fixed WebSocketContext test mock initialization error
  - Fixed useWebSocketSubscription reconnection test double-subscription issue
  - Tests for circuit breaker, ping/pong, token refresh, and exponential backoff completed in previous commit
  - All WebSocket tests now passing

**Success Criteria**:

- [x] Connection recovers from all tested failure scenarios
- [x] Users are notified of connection issues
- [x] No infinite loops or resource leaks (circuit breaker prevents infinite loops)
- [x] Errors are logged appropriately
- [x] Tests pass

**Notes**:

- Uses exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s (max)
- Circuit breaker triggers after 10 attempts (~17 minutes total)
- Socket.IO provides automatic health monitoring via ping/pong
- ConnectionIndicator provides user-facing status
- Future enhancement: Add toast notifications for better UX

**Edge Case Handling**:

1. **Multiple Tabs with Same Campaign**:
   - Each browser tab creates its own WebSocket connection
   - Each connection subscribes to the same campaign room
   - All tabs receive real-time updates independently
   - No cross-tab coordination required (each tab maintains own state)

2. **Network Switches (WiFi ↔ Mobile Data)**:
   - Socket.IO detects disconnect via ping timeout
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Subscriptions automatically re-established on reconnect
   - Cache invalidation resumes seamlessly

3. **Server Restarts**:
   - All client connections disconnect
   - Clients enter reconnection loop with exponential backoff
   - When server comes back online, clients reconnect automatically
   - Circuit breaker prevents infinite retries if server stays down

4. **Redis Connection Failures**:
   - Backend handles Redis failures gracefully (events lost but connections maintained)
   - WebSocket connections remain active even if Redis is unavailable
   - Events resume when Redis reconnects
   - No client-side changes required

5. **Token Expiration/Refresh**:
   - WebSocketContext watches auth store for token changes
   - Automatically disconnects and reconnects with new token
   - Marked as intentional disconnect to prevent reconnection loop
   - Seamless for user (no error states during token refresh)

6. **Circuit Breaker Behavior**:
   - After 10 failed reconnection attempts (~17 minutes):
     - ConnectionState set to Error
     - Error message: "Unable to connect after multiple attempts. Please refresh the page."
     - User must manually refresh browser to reset circuit breaker
     - Prevents battery drain and network spam on mobile devices

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- WebSocket gateway initialization and lifecycle
- Room subscription/unsubscription logic
- Event publishing logic
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Frontend hooks with mocked Socket.IO client

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end event flow from backend to frontend
- Multi-client synchronization
- Cache invalidation and updates
- Reconnection and recovery scenarios

### Manual Testing

- Multiple browser tabs/windows
- Network interruption scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing

## Rollout Plan

1. Deploy backend changes first (Stages 1-3)
2. Verify backend is stable with test clients
3. Deploy frontend changes (Stages 4-6)
4. Monitor connection metrics and error rates
5. Gradually enable for all users

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Redis connection failures break entire system
  - **Mitigation**: Add fallback to polling if WebSocket unavailable

- **Risk**: Too many connections overwhelm server
  - **Mitigation**: Implement connection limits per user, use load balancing

- **Risk**: Events cause cache thrashing
  - **Mitigation**: Implement event batching and debouncing

- **Risk**: Authentication token expires mid-connection
  - **Mitigation**: Implement token refresh mechanism in WebSocket middleware

## Success Metrics

- WebSocket connection success rate > 99%
- Average reconnection time < 5 seconds
- Event delivery latency < 100ms (p95)
- Zero infinite reconnection loops
- All acceptance criteria met

## Dependencies

- TICKET-002: Docker Compose Infrastructure (for Redis) ✓
- TICKET-015: Rules Engine Service Worker (for event publishing) ✓
- TICKET-026: Scheduler Service Worker (for event publishing) ✓

## Notes

- Socket.IO automatically handles WebSocket vs. long-polling fallback
- Redis pub/sub ensures events propagate across multiple API instances
- Consider adding message queue (Bull/BullMQ) for reliable event delivery in future
- May need to optimize event payload sizes for mobile connections
