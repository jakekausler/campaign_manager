## Stage 4 Implementation Notes (Frontend WebSocket Client)

### What Was Implemented

**Files Created:**

- `packages/frontend/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx` - WebSocket context provider with connection management
- `packages/frontend/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite (31 tests)
- `packages/frontend/src/components/ConnectionIndicator.tsx` - Visual connection status component

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/frontend/package.json` - Added socket.io-client dependency
- `packages/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Wrapped app in WebSocketProvider
- `packages/frontend/src/components/index.ts` - Export ConnectionIndicator
- `packages/frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` - Added ConnectionIndicator to header

**Key Features:**

1. **WebSocket Context Provider**:
   - Single global Socket.IO connection for entire application
   - Automatic JWT authentication using token from auth store (via `auth.token` handshake parameter)
   - Manual reconnection control with exponential backoff (1s → 32s max delay)
   - Automatic token refresh detection and reconnection when token changes
   - Connection state management (Connecting, Connected, Disconnected, Error)
   - Proper cleanup on unmount (removes listeners, disconnects socket, clears timeouts)
   - Uses refs to track intentional disconnects vs errors to prevent unnecessary reconnection

2. **Connection Lifecycle**:
   - Only connects when user is authenticated (`isAuthenticated && token`)
   - Connection created automatically on authentication
   - Reconnection scheduled on disconnect/error with exponential backoff
   - Reconnect attempts tracked and displayed to user
   - Supports both WebSocket and polling transports (WebSocket preferred)

3. **Connection Status Indicator**:
   - Color-coded status: green (connected), yellow (connecting), red (error), gray (disconnected)
   - Auto-hides 3 seconds after successful connection to avoid UI clutter
   - Shows reconnection attempt counter during errors/disconnection
   - Only visible to authenticated users
   - Positioned in MainLayout header next to branch selector

4. **React Hooks**:
   - `useWebSocket()` - Full access to socket instance, connection state, error, reconnect attempts
   - `useWebSocketConnection()` - Convenience hook for connection state only
   - Both hooks throw error if used outside WebSocketProvider

**Implementation Patterns:**

- Uses Socket.IO client with `reconnection: false` for manual control
- Exponential backoff calculated: `baseDelay * 2^attempt` (capped at maxDelay)
- Reconnection timeout stored in ref for proper cleanup
- `intentionalDisconnect` ref prevents reconnection when unmounting
- Token changes detected via useEffect watching auth store

**Security:**

- JWT token passed securely via Socket.IO `auth.token` handshake parameter
- No token exposure in debug logs (only logs presence, not value)
- Connection only created when authenticated
- Token refresh triggers automatic reconnection with new token

**Testing:**

- Comprehensive test suite: 31 tests passing
- Tests cover:
  - Connection establishment with authentication
  - Connection state transitions (connecting → connected → disconnected → error)
  - Socket event handler registration and invocation
  - Authentication requirement enforcement
  - Cleanup on unmount
  - Hook usage outside provider (throws error)
  - ConnectionState enum values
- Proper mocking of socket.io-client, env config, and auth store

**Quality Checks:**

- ✅ Type-check passing (no errors)
- ✅ Lint passing (no new errors, pre-existing warnings in other files only)
- ✅ All 31 tests passing
- ✅ Manual code review completed (security, performance, error handling verified)
- ✅ Import order auto-fixed by ESLint
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks passing (format check, lint)

### Stage 4 Frontend WebSocket Client Complete

- ✅ Changes committed (b031566)

## Stage 5 Implementation Notes (Frontend Subscription Hooks)

### What Was Implemented

All subscription hooks were already implemented in commit 2bc92eb, but there was a critical bug in reconnection handling that was fixed in commits 1af5dcc and f25030d.

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocketSubscription.ts` - Fixed double-subscription bugs on reconnection

**Bug Fix #1 (Commit 1af5dcc):**

**Problem**: The reconnection test was failing because subscription was being triggered twice instead of once after reconnection.

**Root Cause**: Both useEffect hooks depended on `connectionState`, causing duplicate subscriptions when transitioning to Connected state after disconnection.

**Solution**:

1. Separated concerns between two useEffect hooks:
   - First effect: Only handles event listener registration/cleanup (removed connectionState dependency)
   - Second effect: Handles subscription/reconnection logic exclusively
2. Added proper state reset when disconnected (`isSubscribedRef.current = false`)

**Bug Fix #2 (Commit f25030d):**

**Problem**: Race condition where multiple rapid calls to `subscribe()` could result in duplicate subscriptions.

**Root Cause**: The `isSubscribedRef.current` flag was only set to `true` in the async callback after `socket.emit()` completed. This allowed multiple calls to `subscribe()` to pass the guard check before any callback executed.

**Solution**:

1. Move `isSubscribedRef.current = true` assignment BEFORE `socket.emit()` call
2. Only reset flag to false in callback if subscription fails
3. This ensures the guard check prevents duplicate subscriptions immediately
4. Maintains proper cleanup and error handling

**Existing Features (From Commit 2bc92eb):**

1. **Generic Hook (`useWebSocketSubscription`)**:
   - Manages subscription lifecycle (subscribe on connect, unsubscribe on unmount)
   - Automatically re-subscribes after reconnection
   - Type-safe event handlers using generics
   - Proper cleanup with refs to avoid stale closures
   - Optional enable/disable flag

2. **Campaign Subscription Hook (`useCampaignSubscription`)**:
   - Subscribes to campaign room on mount
   - Listens for all campaign-related events:
     - `entity_updated` - Generic entity updates
     - `state_invalidated` - Cache invalidation triggers
     - `world_time_changed` - World time progression
     - `settlement_updated` - Settlement changes
     - `structure_updated` - Structure changes
   - Automatically unsubscribes on unmount or campaignId change
   - Conditional subscription based on provided handlers

3. **Settlement Subscription Hook (`useSettlementSubscription`)**:
   - Subscribes to settlement-specific room
   - Listens for settlement and structure events within that settlement
   - Proper room-based filtering

4. **Structure Subscription Hook (`useStructureSubscription`)**:
   - Subscribes to structure-specific room
   - Listens for structure update events
   - Most granular subscription level

**Implementation Patterns:**

- Uses `useRef` for handlers to avoid re-subscriptions when handler functions change
- Uses `isSubscribedRef` to track subscription state and prevent duplicate subscriptions
- Separate effects for event listener registration vs. room subscription
- Type-safe event handlers via TypeScript discriminated unions
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Debug logging controlled by `env.features.debug`

**Testing:**

- Comprehensive test suite: 15/15 tests passing
- Tests cover:
  - Basic subscription and event handling
  - Cleanup on unmount
  - Disabled subscriptions
  - Reconnection handling (now fixed)
  - Handler updates without re-subscription
  - Campaign/settlement/structure-specific subscriptions
  - Multiple event types

**Quality Checks:**

- ✅ Type-check passing (no errors)
- ✅ Lint passing (only pre-existing warnings in other files)
- ✅ All 15 tests passing (reconnection bug fixed)
- ✅ Manual code review completed

### Stage 5 Frontend Subscription Hooks Complete

All frontend subscription hooks are now fully implemented and tested:

- ✅ Generic `useWebSocketSubscription` hook with lifecycle management
- ✅ `useCampaignSubscription` hook for campaign-level events
- ✅ `useSettlementSubscription` hook for settlement-level events

## Stage 7 Implementation Notes (Error Handling & Resilience)

### What Was Implemented

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/frontend/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx` - Added circuit breaker and health monitoring
- `packages/frontend/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.test.tsx` - Added 5 new tests for resilience
- `packages/frontend/src/components/ConnectionIndicator.tsx` - Enhanced to show circuit breaker status
- `plan/TICKET-029-implementation-plan.md` - Updated with Stage 6 completion and Stage 7 documentation

**Key Features:**

1. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**:
   - Max reconnection attempts: 10 (total ~17 minutes with exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s)
   - Prevents infinite reconnection loops and battery drain on mobile devices
   - Triggers permanent error state after max attempts exceeded
   - Clear error message: "Unable to connect after multiple attempts. Please refresh the page."
   - User must manually refresh browser to reset circuit breaker
   - Structured error logging with circuit breaker trigger notification

2. **Health Check Monitoring**:
   - Leverages Socket.IO built-in ping/pong monitoring (25s interval, 5s timeout)
   - Added explicit ping/pong event handlers for debugging and monitoring
   - Logs ping/pong events in debug mode for health monitoring
   - Automatic reconnection on health check failure (handled by Socket.IO)

3. **Enhanced ConnectionIndicator**:
   - Shows "(Max retries reached)" when circuit breaker triggers
   - Displays reconnection attempt counter during reconnection
   - User-friendly status messages for all connection states
   - Auto-hides after 3 seconds when connected (reduces UI clutter)
   - Color-coded status: green (connected), yellow (connecting), red (error), gray (disconnected)

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Added 5 new tests for error resilience scenarios
   - **Test 1**: Circuit breaker triggering after max attempts
   - **Test 2**: Reconnect attempt reset on successful connection
   - **Test 3**: Ping/pong health monitoring handlers
   - **Test 4**: Token refresh reconnection behavior
   - **Test 5**: Exponential backoff delay calculation verification
   - All tests use fake timers for deterministic testing

5. **Edge Case Documentation**:
   - **Multiple Tabs**: Independent connections per tab, all receive real-time updates
   - **Network Switches (WiFi ↔ Mobile Data)**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - **Server Restarts**: Clients auto-reconnect when server returns online
   - **Redis Connection Failures**: Backend handles gracefully, WebSocket connections maintained
   - **Token Expiration/Refresh**: Seamless reconnection with new token (no error states)
   - **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents infinite retries if server stays down for extended period

**Implementation Patterns:**

- Circuit breaker check occurs before each reconnection attempt
- Error logging uses `console.error()` with structured messages and context
- Connection state transitions properly handle circuit breaker state
- Tests verify exponential backoff delays match expected pattern: [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000]

**Quality Checks:**

- ✅ Type-check passing (no compilation errors)
- ✅ Lint passing (only pre-existing `any` warnings in other test files)
- ✅ Manual code review completed (no critical issues)
- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passing

### Stage 7 Error Handling & Resilience Complete

## Stage 6 Implementation Notes (WebSocket Cache Synchronization)

### What Was Implemented

Implemented Apollo Client cache and Zustand state synchronization with WebSocket real-time events, completing the real-time update loop from backend → WebSocket → frontend cache → UI.

**Files Created:**

- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocketCacheSync.ts` - Centralized cache sync hook (307 lines)
- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocketCacheSync.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite (16 tests)

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/index.ts` - Export new hook
- `packages/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Mount hook in AppWithCacheSync component
- `plan/TICKET-029-implementation-plan.md` - Mark Stage 4 tasks complete

**Key Features:**

1. **Centralized Cache Sync Hook (`useWebSocketCacheSync`)**:
   - Subscribes to campaign WebSocket events via `useCampaignSubscription`
   - Routes events to specialized handlers based on event type
   - Updates Apollo cache and Zustand state automatically
   - Mounted once at app level for global cache synchronization

2. **Event Handler Strategies**:
   - **entity_updated**: Evicts specific entity from cache by typename + ID using `cache.evict()`, forcing refetch on next query
   - **state_invalidated**: Evicts computed fields based on scope (campaign-wide or entity-specific)
   - **world_time_changed**: Dual strategy - updates Zustand store for immediate feedback + evicts time-dependent queries
   - **settlement_updated/structure_updated**: Evicts entity + parent queries, handles delete/create/update operations

3. **Apollo Cache Operations**:
   - Uses `cache.evict()` + `cache.gc()` pattern for cache invalidation
   - Simpler than `cache.modify()` and ensures consistency
   - Evicts queries by field name for list queries (e.g., `settlementsByKingdom`)
   - Evicts entities by cache ID for detail queries

4. **Integration Patterns**:
   - `useApolloClient` imported from `@apollo/client/react` (Apollo Client v4)
   - CampaignId conversion: null → undefined for subscription hook compatibility
   - Debug logging controlled by `env.features.debug`

**Implementation Details:**

The hook follows a clean separation of concerns:

- Each event type has its own handler function (5 handlers total)
- Handlers are memoized with `useCallback` for stability
- Event subscription only active when enabled and campaignId is present
- All cache operations are type-safe using Apollo's TypeScript types

**Testing:**

Comprehensive test suite with 16 tests covering:

- Subscription lifecycle (enable/disable, campaignId changes)
- Each event handler's cache operations
- Error handling for unknown entity types
- All event payload variations (create/update/delete, campaign/entity scope)

**Quality Checks:**

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passing (pnpm type-check)
- ✅ ESLint passing (0 errors, only pre-existing warnings)
- ✅ Import order auto-fixed by ESLint
- ✅ All 16 tests passing
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks passing (format check, lint)

### Stage 6 WebSocket Cache Synchronization Complete

Real-time update loop is now fully functional:

1. Backend services emit WebSocket events on CRUD operations
2. WebSocket Gateway publishes events to Redis pub/sub (multi-instance support)
3. Frontend receives events via Socket.IO connection
4. `useWebSocketCacheSync` hook updates Apollo cache and Zustand state
5. UI components automatically re-render with fresh data

- ✅ Centralized cache sync hook created and mounted
- ✅ All 5 event types handled (entity_updated, state_invalidated, world_time_changed, settlement_updated, structure_updated)
- ✅ Apollo cache eviction strategy implemented
- ✅ Zustand store integration for world time
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (16/16 tests passing)
- ✅ Type-check and lint passing
- ✅ Changes committed (c5459b7)

## Stage 4 Implementation Notes (Backend Integration)

### What Was Implemented

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/api/src/graphql/services/campaign.service.ts` - Added WebSocket event publishing
- `packages/api/src/graphql/services/settlement.service.ts` - Added WebSocket event publishing
- `packages/api/src/graphql/services/structure.service.ts` - Added WebSocket event publishing
- `packages/api/src/graphql/services/world-time.service.ts` - Added WebSocket event publishing

**Key Features:**

1. **Campaign Service Integration**:
   - Injected `WebSocketPublisherService` into constructor
   - Emit `entity_updated` events on create/update/delete operations
   - Track changed fields during updates for granular event payloads
   - Include userId and source metadata in all events

2. **Settlement Service Integration**:
   - Injected `WebSocketPublisherService` into constructor
   - Emit `settlement_updated` events with 'create'/'update'/'delete' operations
   - Fetch campaignId through settlement→kingdom→campaign relation
   - Publish to both campaign and settlement-specific rooms
   - Track changed fields (name, level, variables, variableSchemas)

3. **Structure Service Integration**:
   - Injected `WebSocketPublisherService` into constructor
   - Emit `structure_updated` events with 'create'/'update'/'delete' operations
   - Fetch campaignId through structure→settlement→kingdom→campaign relation
   - Publish to campaign, settlement, and structure-specific rooms
   - Track changed fields (name, type, level, variables, variableSchemas)

4. **World Time Service Integration**:
   - Injected `WebSocketPublisherService` into constructor
   - Emit `world_time_changed` events when time is advanced
   - Calculate elapsed time in seconds for event payload
   - Include previous and new world time timestamps

**Implementation Pattern:**

All services follow consistent pattern:

1. Inject `WebSocketPublisherService` in constructor
2. Import event creation helpers from `@campaign/shared`
3. Track changed fields during update operations
4. Publish events after successful database operations
5. Include userId and source='api' metadata

**Event Room Targeting:**

- Campaign events → campaign room
- Settlement events → campaign room + settlement room
- Structure events → campaign room + settlement room + structure room
- World time events → campaign room

Events automatically distribute across all API instances via Redis pub/sub adapter.

### Import Order Fix

Fixed ESLint import order violations in all modified files by:

- Separating external, shared, and local imports with blank lines
- Moving WebSocketPublisherService import before type imports
- Running `eslint --fix` to auto-correct ordering

### Tests Status

**No new tests in this stage** - Tests will be added in Stage 6 as part of integration testing.

Existing tests continue to pass:

- ✅ Type-check passed (no compilation errors)
- ✅ Lint passed (only pre-existing `any` warnings in test files)
- ✅ All existing unit and integration tests passing

### Stage 4 Backend Integration Complete

All backend domain services now emit WebSocket events on CRUD operations:

- ✅ CampaignService emits entity_updated events
- ✅ SettlementService emits settlement_updated events
- ✅ StructureService emits structure_updated events
- ✅ WorldTimeService emits world_time_changed events
- ✅ Events properly scoped to campaign/settlement/structure rooms
- ✅ Changed fields tracked for granular updates
- ✅ Type-check and lint passing
- ✅ Import order issues resolved
- ✅ Changes committed (21aa2e0)

### Next Steps

Stage 5 will implement the frontend WebSocket client with connection management and auto-reconnection.

## Stage 2 Implementation Notes

### What Was Implemented

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.module.ts` - Added AuthModule import
- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.gateway.ts` - Added authentication and subscription handlers

**Key Features:**

1. **Connection Authentication**:
   - JWT token extraction from `handshake.auth.token` or `handshake.query.token`
   - Token verification using `JwtService.verify()`
   - Authenticated user data stored in `socket.data` as `AuthenticatedSocketData`
   - Unauthenticated connections are rejected and disconnected immediately
   - Full error handling and logging for auth failures

2. **Module Dependencies**:
   - Imported `AuthModule` to provide `JwtService` and `CampaignMembershipService`
   - Added constructor injection for both services into `WebSocketGatewayClass`

3. **Subscription Handlers** (6 new `@SubscribeMessage` methods):
   - `subscribe_campaign` - Validates user access via `CampaignMembershipService.canView()`
   - `subscribe_settlement` - Basic implementation (parent campaign lookup deferred to Stage 3)
   - `subscribe_structure` - Basic implementation (parent campaign lookup deferred to Stage 3)
   - `unsubscribe_campaign`, `unsubscribe_settlement`, `unsubscribe_structure`
   - All handlers return `{success: boolean, error?: string}` responses
   - Comprehensive error handling and debug/info logging

4. **Authorization**:
   - Campaign subscriptions check `canView(campaignId, userId)` before allowing room join
   - Unauthorized attempts return `{success: false, error: 'Unauthorized'}`
   - Settlement/structure handlers documented for enhancement in Stage 3

### Known Limitations

- Settlement and structure subscriptions don't yet validate parent campaign access
  - Will be enhanced in Stage 3 when entity relationships are available
  - Currently allow subscription without campaign-level authorization check

### Tests Status

**✅ All tests implemented and passing (31/31 tests)**:

- ✅ Connection authentication (valid/invalid/missing JWT tokens) - 6 tests
- ✅ Campaign subscription authorization (authorized vs unauthorized users) - 3 tests
- ✅ Settlement/structure subscription (basic functionality) - 4 tests
- ✅ Unsubscription operations - 6 tests
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous subscriptions - 2 tests
- ✅ Automatic room cleanup on disconnect - 2 tests
- ✅ Gateway initialization - 3 tests
- ✅ Client lifecycle - 2 tests
- ✅ Broadcasting methods - 2 tests
- ✅ Error handling - throughout

### Security Improvements

Applied from code review:

1. Added validation in getRoomName() to prevent malformed room names from empty entityIds
2. Improved error logging to prevent JWT token leakage in logs (only log error messages, not full error objects)
3. Added explicit security warnings for settlement/structure subscriptions that bypass campaign authorization (will be addressed in Stage 3)

### Stage 2 Complete

All tasks completed:

- ✅ Comprehensive test suite written and passing
- ✅ Type-check passing
- ✅ Lint passing (no new warnings)
- ✅ Code review completed with critical issues addressed
- ✅ Changes committed (699fcd6)
