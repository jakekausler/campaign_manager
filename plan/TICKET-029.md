# TICKET-029: Real-time Updates via WebSocket/Redis

## Status

- [ ] Completed (Stage 2 of 8 - COMPLETE)
- **Commits**:
  - cdc825c - feat(api): implement WebSocket infrastructure with Redis adapter (Stage 1)
  - 699fcd6 - test(api): add comprehensive tests for WebSocket subscription system (Stage 2)

## Stage 2 Implementation Notes

### What Was Implemented

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.module.ts` - Added AuthModule import
- `packages/api/src/websocket/websocket.gateway.ts` - Added authentication and subscription handlers

**Key Features:**

1. **Connection Authentication**:
   - JWT token extraction from `handshake.auth.token` or `handshake.query.token`
   - Token verification using `JwtService.verify()`
   - Authenticated user data stored in `socket.data` as `AuthenticatedSocketData`
   - Unauthenticated connections are rejected and disconnected immediately
   - Full error handling and logging for auth failures

2. **Module Dependencies**:
   - Imported `AuthModule` to provide `JwtService` and `CampaignMembershipService`
   - Added constructor injection for both services into `WebSocketGatewayClass`

3. **Subscription Handlers** (6 new `@SubscribeMessage` methods):
   - `subscribe_campaign` - Validates user access via `CampaignMembershipService.canView()`
   - `subscribe_settlement` - Basic implementation (parent campaign lookup deferred to Stage 3)
   - `subscribe_structure` - Basic implementation (parent campaign lookup deferred to Stage 3)
   - `unsubscribe_campaign`, `unsubscribe_settlement`, `unsubscribe_structure`
   - All handlers return `{success: boolean, error?: string}` responses
   - Comprehensive error handling and debug/info logging

4. **Authorization**:
   - Campaign subscriptions check `canView(campaignId, userId)` before allowing room join
   - Unauthorized attempts return `{success: false, error: 'Unauthorized'}`
   - Settlement/structure handlers documented for enhancement in Stage 3

### Known Limitations

- Settlement and structure subscriptions don't yet validate parent campaign access
  - Will be enhanced in Stage 3 when entity relationships are available
  - Currently allow subscription without campaign-level authorization check

### Tests Status

**✅ All tests implemented and passing (31/31 tests)**:

- ✅ Connection authentication (valid/invalid/missing JWT tokens) - 6 tests
- ✅ Campaign subscription authorization (authorized vs unauthorized users) - 3 tests
- ✅ Settlement/structure subscription (basic functionality) - 4 tests
- ✅ Unsubscription operations - 6 tests
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous subscriptions - 2 tests
- ✅ Automatic room cleanup on disconnect - 2 tests
- ✅ Gateway initialization - 3 tests
- ✅ Client lifecycle - 2 tests
- ✅ Broadcasting methods - 2 tests
- ✅ Error handling - throughout

### Security Improvements

Applied from code review:

1. Added validation in getRoomName() to prevent malformed room names from empty entityIds
2. Improved error logging to prevent JWT token leakage in logs (only log error messages, not full error objects)
3. Added explicit security warnings for settlement/structure subscriptions that bypass campaign authorization (will be addressed in Stage 3)

### Stage 2 Complete

All tasks completed:

- ✅ Comprehensive test suite written and passing
- ✅ Type-check passing
- ✅ Lint passing (no new warnings)
- ✅ Code review completed with critical issues addressed
- ✅ Changes committed (699fcd6)

## Description

Implement real-time updates using WebSocket (Socket.IO) and Redis pub/sub to push state changes and invalidations to connected clients.

## Scope of Work

1. Add Socket.IO to API service
2. Configure Redis pub/sub adapter
3. Implement room-based subscriptions (per campaign)
4. Create event types (entity_updated, state_invalidated, world_time_changed, settlement_updated, structure_updated)
5. Add client-side WebSocket connection
6. Implement auto-reconnection
7. Create subscription management hooks
8. Settlement-scoped room subscriptions (settlement:id)
9. Structure-scoped room subscriptions (structure:id)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clients connect via WebSocket
- [ ] Clients subscribe to campaign updates
- [ ] Updates broadcast to all subscribers
- [ ] Invalidations trigger UI refresh
- [ ] Connection survives network issues
- [ ] Multiple clients stay in sync
- [ ] settlement_updated events publish correctly
- [ ] structure_updated events publish correctly
- [ ] Can subscribe to settlement-scoped rooms
- [ ] Can subscribe to structure-scoped rooms

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-002, TICKET-015, TICKET-026

## Estimated Effort

3-4 days
