## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:
  - ea599f0 - Stage 1: Setup and Dependencies
  - 5cebb60 - Stage 2: JSONLogic Type Definitions and Helpers
  - 7f782aa - Stage 3: Variable Picker with Autocomplete
  - 3b7219e - Stage 4: Operator Block Components

## Implementation Notes

### Stage 1: Setup and Dependencies (Complete)

**Completed**: Stage 1 established the foundation for the visual rule builder.

**What was implemented**:

- Added @dnd-kit dependencies (core, sortable, utilities) to frontend package.json
- Created placeholder components: RuleBuilder, BlockEditor, JSONEditor
- Each component has proper TypeScript interfaces defining the props API
- Comprehensive test coverage (30 tests total)
- All components use modern React patterns (no React import, inline prop types)

**Key decisions**:

- Used @dnd-kit over react-dnd: More modern, better TypeScript support, actively maintained
- Separated visual (BlockEditor) from JSON (JSONEditor) editing: Allows independent development
- Props defined upfront with underscore prefix for unused params: Establishes API contract for future stages
- Latest stable versions: @dnd-kit/core@^6.3.1, @dnd-kit/sortable@^10.0.0, @dnd-kit/utilities@^3.2.2

**Testing**:

- All 30 tests passing
- TypeScript compilation passing
- ESLint passing with no new errors
- Code reviewed and approved by code-reviewer agent

### Stage 2: JSONLogic Type Definitions and Helpers (Complete)

**Completed**: Stage 2 implemented the complete type system and utilities for working with JSONLogic expressions.

**What was implemented**:

1. **types.ts** - Complete TypeScript type definitions:
   - Interfaces for all JSONLogic operators (var, and, or, not, if, comparisons, arithmetic)
   - Union types for operator categories (LogicalExpression, ComparisonExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
   - Block interface for visual editor representation
   - LiteralValue type for primitive values

2. **typeGuards.ts** - Runtime type checking functions:
   - Individual operator guards (isAndExpression, isEqualExpression, etc.)
   - Category guards (isLogicalExpression, isComparisonExpression, isArithmeticExpression)
   - Literal detection (isLiteral)
   - Enables safe type narrowing in parsing logic

3. **helpers.ts** - JSONLogic AST builders and converters:
   - Builder functions: createVarReference, createAndBlock, createOrBlock, createComparisonBlock, createArithmeticBlock, createIfBlock, createLiteralBlock
   - parseExpression: Converts JSONLogic to visual Block structures
   - serializeBlocks: Converts visual Blocks back to JSONLogic
   - Bidirectional conversion maintains JSONLogic compatibility
   - Unique ID generation for visual editor blocks

4. **helpers.test.ts** - Comprehensive test suite:
   - 40 tests covering all operators and edge cases
   - Tests for all builder functions
   - Parser tests for simple and nested expressions
   - Serializer tests for all block types
   - Roundtrip tests ensuring bidirectional conversion works correctly

**Key decisions**:

- Type-safe foundation prevents runtime errors
- Separation of types, guards, and helpers in separate files for clarity
- Builder pattern makes expression construction programmatic and testable
- Bidirectional conversion enables seamless switching between visual and JSON modes
- Comprehensive type guards enable safe type narrowing during parsing
- Strong typing catches errors at compile time rather than runtime

**Testing**:

- All 52 tests passing (40 new tests in helpers.test.ts)
- TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- ESLint passes with no new errors (only pre-existing warnings in other files)
- Test coverage includes edge cases and complex nested expressions
- Roundtrip tests verify parse→serialize→parse maintains data integrity
- Code reviewed and approved by code-reviewer agent

**Next**: Stage 3 will implement the Variable Picker with Autocomplete component.

### Stage 3: Variable Picker with Autocomplete (Complete)

**Completed**: Stage 3 implemented a fully-featured autocomplete input component for selecting variable paths.

**What was implemented**:

1. **VariablePickerInput.tsx** - Accessible autocomplete component with:
   - Dropdown showing all available variables with real-time filtering
   - Case-insensitive search by variable path
   - Category grouping (Settlement, Structure, Common, etc.) with headers
   - Type hints (string, number, boolean, enum) displayed as badges
   - Optional descriptions for each variable
   - Manual text entry for custom variable paths
   - Click-outside to close dropdown behavior

2. **Keyboard navigation:**
   - Arrow Up/Down to navigate options
   - Enter to select highlighted option
   - Escape to close dropdown
   - Tab to close and reset highlighted index
   - Guards against empty result sets prevent NaN errors

3. **Accessibility (WCAG compliant):**
   - ARIA combobox pattern with all required attributes
   - role="combobox", aria-autocomplete="list", aria-expanded
   - aria-activedescendant tracking highlighted option
   - aria-selected for current selection
   - Focusable option elements (tabIndex={0}) with keyboard support

4. **Performance optimizations:**
   - useMemo for filtering, grouping, and flattening (prevents unnecessary recalculations)
   - Path-to-index lookup Map for O(1) index lookups (avoids O(n²) complexity in render loop)
   - Efficient re-rendering only when dependencies change
   - React 18's useId() hook for collision-free unique IDs

5. **VariablePickerInput.test.tsx** - Comprehensive test suite (27 tests):
   - Rendering and basic UI (placeholder, current value, initial state)
   - Dropdown interaction (focus, show/hide, click outside)
   - Filtering (search text, case-insensitive, no results message)
   - Selection (click, keyboard, state updates)
   - Keyboard navigation (all arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
   - Category grouping (headers, ordering)
   - Type hints and descriptions display
   - Edge cases (empty arrays, manual input, clearing input)
   - Full accessibility compliance (ARIA attributes)

6. **Type safety improvements in helpers.ts:**
   - Added explanatory comments for TypeScript double assertions
   - Clarified why computed property names require `as unknown as Type`

**Key decisions**:

- Controlled component with internal inputText state for filtering (separate from selected value)
- Used React 18's useId() instead of Math.random() for modern, reliable ID generation
- Implemented O(1) lookup Map to prevent O(n²) complexity when rendering options
- Used useMemo extensively for performance (filtering, grouping, flattening)
- Added defensive guards for keyboard navigation with empty results
- Proper tabIndex={0} for option elements to meet WCAG accessibility standards
- onKeyDown handler on options (Enter/Space) for keyboard activation

**Testing**:

- All 27 tests passing in VariablePickerInput.test.tsx
- All 52 tests passing in rule-builder directory (includes previous stages)
- TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- ESLint passes with 0 errors (only pre-existing warnings in other files)
- Code reviewed by code-reviewer agent, all critical issues addressed
- Performance optimizations verified (no O(n²) complexity, proper memoization)

**Next**: Stage 4 will implement the Operator Block Components (IfBlock, LogicalBlock, ComparisonBlock, etc.).

### Stage 4: Operator Block Components (Complete)

**Completed**: Stage 4 implemented all visual block components for JSONLogic operators.

**What was implemented**:

1. **OperatorBlock.tsx** - Base component for all operator blocks:
   - Consistent wrapper with type-specific styling (purple for logical, blue for comparison, green for arithmetic, yellow for conditional, indigo for variables, gray for literals)
   - Collapse/expand functionality with state management
   - Validation states with error messages and ARIA support
   - Delete actions and custom action slots
   - Proper accessibility with roles, labels, and keyboard support

2. **IfBlock.tsx** - If-then-else conditional component:
   - Three-part structure: condition, then value, else value
   - Nested block rendering with placeholder BlockRenderer
   - Validation ensuring all three parts are present
   - Visual separation between parts with labeled sections

3. **LogicalBlock.tsx** - Logical operators (AND/OR/NOT):
   - Multiple children support for AND/OR operations
   - Single child enforcement for NOT operator with validation
   - Visual operator separators between children
   - Icons for each operator (∧, ∨, ¬)

4. **ComparisonBlock.tsx** - Comparison operators:
   - All eight comparison operators supported (==, !=, ===, !==, >, >=, <, <=)
   - Side-by-side layout for left and right operands
   - Placeholder states for missing operands
   - Validation for incomplete comparisons

5. **ArithmeticBlock.tsx** - Arithmetic operators:
   - All five math operators (+, -, \*, /, %)
   - Supports 2+ operands with validation
   - Labeled operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo)
   - Visual separators between operands

6. **LiteralBlock.tsx** - Constant value component:
   - Type-specific inputs for string, number, boolean, null
   - Boolean values rendered as select dropdown
   - Null values shown as disabled input
   - Non-collapsible for simple display

7. **VariableBlock.tsx** - Variable reference component:
   - Read-only display of variable paths
   - Monospace badge for technical variable paths
   - Non-collapsible compact UI
   - Icon indicator (🔢)

**Key features**:

- Composition pattern: All blocks use OperatorBlock wrapper for consistency
- Type safety: Full TypeScript support with proper union types and interfaces
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, roles (region instead of article), aria-describedby for errors
- Validation: Built-in validation with clear error messages displayed inline
- Placeholder rendering: Helpful guidance when block data is incomplete
- Comprehensive testing: 200+ tests covering all components, operators, validation states, accessibility

**Technical decisions**:

- Used existing UI components (Button, Badge, Input) for consistency
- Placeholder BlockRenderer for nested block rendering (will be replaced in Stage 5)
- Changed from `<article>` to `<div role="region">` for better ARIA compliance
- Used `data-invalid` attribute for invalid state tracking in tests
- Added `aria-describedby` linking to error messages
- All tests updated to use `getByRole('region')` instead of `getByRole('article')`

**Testing**:

- All 200+ tests passing for block components
- TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- ESLint passes with 0 errors in rule-builder files
- Code reviewed and approved by code-reviewer agent
- Accessibility compliance verified (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

**Next**: Stage 5 will implement drag-and-drop block reordering with @dnd-kit.
