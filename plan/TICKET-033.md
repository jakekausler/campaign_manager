# TICKET-033: Caching Layer with Redis

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:

## Description

Implement Redis-based caching for computed availability, rule evaluations, and expensive queries with proper invalidation.

## Scope of Work

1. Create caching service abstraction
2. Implement cache key generation strategy
3. Cache keys for Settlement state (level, variables, structures)
4. Cache keys for Structure state (type, level, variables)
5. Add caching for rule evaluations
6. Cache computed availability sets
7. Cache expensive spatial queries
8. Implement cache invalidation on updates
9. Cascading cache invalidation (Settlement changes → invalidate Structure caches)
10. Cascading cache invalidation (Structure changes → invalidate parent Settlement cache)
11. Add cache statistics and monitoring
12. Configure TTL policies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rule evaluations are cached
- [ ] Settlement state is cached correctly
- [ ] Structure state is cached correctly
- [ ] Cache hits improve response time
- [ ] Invalidation clears stale data
- [ ] Settlement changes invalidate Structure caches
- [ ] Structure changes invalidate Settlement cache
- [ ] Cache keys are unique and predictable
- [ ] TTL prevents unbounded growth
- [ ] Cache statistics available

## Dependencies

- Requires: TICKET-002, TICKET-015

## Estimated Effort

2-3 days
