# TICKET-034: Comprehensive Test Suite

## Status

- [ ] Completed
- **Commits**:

## Description

Create comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for all major functionality.

## Scope of Work

1. Set up Jest for unit/integration tests
2. Set up Cypress for E2E tests
3. Write unit tests for:
   - Rules parser/evaluator
   - DAG builder/cycle detection
   - Version resolution
   - Temporal queries
   - Spatial queries
   - SettlementService (CRUD, level management, typed variables)
   - StructureService (CRUD, type management, level management, typed variables)
4. Write integration tests for:
   - Entity CRUD flows
   - Versioning and branching
   - Effect execution
   - Rules evaluation pipeline
   - Settlement-Location relationships
   - Settlement-Kingdom-Structure hierarchies
   - Settlement/Structure level changes triggering rules engine
5. Write E2E tests for:
   - User authentication flow
   - Campaign creation workflow
   - Map editing
   - Cross-view synchronization
   - Kingdom → Settlement creation → Structure creation → rules evaluation
6. Add test coverage reporting
7. Configure CI to run tests

## Acceptance Criteria
