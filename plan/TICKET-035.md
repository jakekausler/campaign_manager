## Description

Create comprehensive demo seed data showcasing all features and write user/developer documentation.

## Scope of Work

1. Create demo world with:
   - Multiple regions with evolving borders
   - 20+ locations (cities, dungeons, landmarks)
   - 5-10 demo Settlements distributed across regions
   - 20+ demo Structures across Settlements (temples, barracks, markets, libraries)
   - Sample characters with levels
   - 15+ events with conditions and effects
   - 10+ encounters with dependencies
   - Multiple branches showing alternate timelines
   - Demonstrate Settlement and Structure level progression in seed data
   - Show Settlement and Structure typed variables in examples
   - Create demo events conditional on Settlement/Structure levels or variables
2. Write user documentation:
   - Getting started guide
   - Feature tutorials (map editing, rules, branching)
   - Video walkthrough scripts
3. Write developer documentation:
   - Architecture overview
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guide
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Settlement management guide (creation, levels, variable schemas)
   - Structure management guide (types, hierarchical structure)
   - Settlement/Structure relationship documentation
   - Typed variable examples for Settlements and Structures
   - How Settlement/Structure state affects rules and conditions
4. Create README files for each package
5. Add inline code documentation (JSDoc/TSDoc)
