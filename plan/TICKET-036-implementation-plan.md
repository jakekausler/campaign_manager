# TICKET-036 Implementation Plan: Settlement & Structure Hierarchical UI

## Overview

Create comprehensive UI components for managing Settlement-Structure hierarchies within the Entity Inspector, including visual tree displays, add/remove operations, level management, and typed variable editing.

## Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation - Settlement Hierarchy Panel Component ✅

**Goal**: Create the base hierarchy panel that displays Settlement → Structures as a tree

**Commit**: `97d0e63` - feat(frontend): add Settlement hierarchy panel with tree view

**Tasks**:

- [x] Install tree UI dependencies (react-arborist or custom tree component) - Built custom tree instead
- [x] Create `SettlementHierarchyPanel.tsx` component in `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/`
- [x] Implement tree rendering with Settlement as root and Structures as children
- [x] Add expand/collapse functionality for structure nodes
- [x] Display quick stats (total structures, average structure level)
- [x] Add structure icons based on type (8 types: temple, barracks, market, library, forge, tavern, fortress, citadel)
- [x] Style with Tailwind CSS matching existing Entity Inspector theme
- [x] Write unit tests for hierarchy rendering (31 test cases, 465 lines)
- [x] Add to SettlementPanel as a new "Hierarchy" section

**Implementation Notes**:

- Chose custom tree component instead of external library to minimize dependencies
- Component: 228 lines of production code
- Tests: 465 lines with comprehensive coverage (31 test cases across 10 describe blocks)
- Icon mapping for 8+ structure types using lucide-react
- Loading, error, and empty states with appropriate fallback UI
- MSW handler added for GetStructuresForMap GraphQL query
- Mock data updated: added structure-3 (Grand Library) to settlement-1
- Skeleton component enhanced with data-testid attribute for testing
- All 1371 frontend tests passing
- Code Reviewer approved: no security issues, good performance, clean code

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET

- ✅ Tree displays Settlement with nested Structures
- ✅ Expand/collapse works smoothly
- ✅ Quick stats calculate correctly
- ✅ Visual styling is consistent with Entity Inspector

### Stage 2: Add Structure Modal & GraphQL Integration ✅

**Goal**: Implement "Add Structure" workflow with modal UI

**Commit**: `2107f05` - feat(frontend): add Structure creation modal with form validation

**Tasks**:

- [x] Create `AddStructureModal.tsx` in `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/`
- [x] Add structure type selector with icons (temple, barracks, market, library, forge, tavern, fortress, citadel)
- [x] Implement form fields: name, type, initial level
- [x] Create `useCreateStructure` mutation hook if not exists - Hook already existed
- [x] Add form validation (required name 2-100 chars, valid type from 8 options, level 1-10 integer)
- [x] Implement submit handler with optimistic UI updates via Apollo Client
- [x] Add loading and error states with visual feedback
- [x] Integrate modal trigger button in SettlementHierarchyPanel (showAddModal state)
- [x] Write tests for modal form validation (25 comprehensive test cases)
- [x] Write integration tests for structure creation

**Implementation Notes**:

- Component: 356 lines with comprehensive validation logic
- Tests: 414 lines with 25 passing test cases
- Form validation: Touch-tracked errors (only show after interaction)
- Structure types: 8 types with lucide-react icons (Church, Swords, Store, BookOpen, Hammer, Beer, Castle)
- Validation function: `validateStructureForm` with detailed error messages
- Loading states: Disabled buttons and "Creating..." text with spinner icon
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to submit, Escape to cancel
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant with ARIA attributes and role="alert" errors
- Integration: Modal state managed in SettlementHierarchyPanel with onSuccess callback
- Cache updates: Apollo Client automatically refetches structures after creation
- Code Reviewer: Approved with zero critical issues
- Fixed ESLint errors: 3 unused imports removed

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET

- ✅ Modal opens/closes correctly with form reset
- ✅ Structure type selector shows all 8 types with icons in grid layout
- ✅ Form validation prevents invalid submissions (name, type, level)
- ✅ New structures appear in hierarchy immediately via cache updates
