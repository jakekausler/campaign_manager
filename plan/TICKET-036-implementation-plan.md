# TICKET-036 Implementation Plan: Settlement & Structure Hierarchical UI

## Overview

Create comprehensive UI components for managing Settlement-Structure hierarchies within the Entity Inspector, including visual tree displays, add/remove operations, level management, and typed variable editing.

## Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation - Settlement Hierarchy Panel Component ✅

**Goal**: Create the base hierarchy panel that displays Settlement → Structures as a tree

**Commit**: `97d0e63` - feat(frontend): add Settlement hierarchy panel with tree view

**Tasks**:

- [x] Install tree UI dependencies (react-arborist or custom tree component) - Built custom tree instead
- [x] Create `SettlementHierarchyPanel.tsx` component in `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity-inspector/`
- [x] Implement tree rendering with Settlement as root and Structures as children
- [x] Add expand/collapse functionality for structure nodes
- [x] Display quick stats (total structures, average structure level)
- [x] Add structure icons based on type (8 types: temple, barracks, market, library, forge, tavern, fortress, citadel)
- [x] Style with Tailwind CSS matching existing Entity Inspector theme
- [x] Write unit tests for hierarchy rendering (31 test cases, 465 lines)
- [x] Add to SettlementPanel as a new "Hierarchy" section

**Implementation Notes**:

- Chose custom tree component instead of external library to minimize dependencies
- Component: 228 lines of production code
- Tests: 465 lines with comprehensive coverage (31 test cases across 10 describe blocks)
